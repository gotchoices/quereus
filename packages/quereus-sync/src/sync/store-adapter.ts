/**
 * Store adapter for applying remote sync changes.
 *
 * Implements the ApplyToStoreCallback interface over the store module's
 * external row-write entry point (`StoreTable.applyExternalRowChanges` —
 * table-owned key encoding, secondary-index and stats maintenance) plus the
 * engine's batch ingestion seam (`Database.ingestExternalRowChanges` — change
 * capture for `Database.watch` + global assertions, materialized-view
 * maintenance, opt-in parent-side FK actions).
 *
 * Per `applyToStore(dataChanges, schemaChanges, options)` invocation:
 *   1. Schema changes execute via `db.exec`, with the resulting module schema
 *      events pre-marked remote. Replicated DDL is applied IDEMPOTENTLY: an
 *      object already in the migration's wanted state with a matching definition
 *      is counted applied without re-exec'ing, so two peers that independently
 *      created the same table converge instead of the receiver failing "already
 *      exists" on every sync (see {@link decideSchemaChange}).
 *
 *      Most DDL runs BEFORE the data (the batch's rows need the new shape to land
 *      in), but a migration that VALIDATES the rows the table already holds — `set
 *      not null`, `add constraint`, a UNIQUE index create — is legal only against a
 *      row set this batch may still be delivering, so it runs AFTER the row writes
 *      instead. {@link partitionSchemaChanges} splits the batch into those two
 *      phases; {@link validatesExistingRows} is the classifier.
 *   2. Data changes are grouped per table, then per row; each row group
 *      collapses to ONE `ExternalRowOp` — the group's NET effect in list
 *      order, which the caller delivers HLC-ordered (a delete resets the row to
 *      absent and later column updates rebuild it from PK+nulls; updates with no
 *      later delete merge onto the pre-read existing row — UPSERT semantics; see
 *      {@link buildRowOp}).
 *   3. `StoreTable.applyExternalRowChanges(ops)` applies the table's ops to
 *      committed storage and returns the EFFECTIVE changes (no-ops — absent
 *      delete, value-identical upsert — are suppressed: no storage write, no
 *      module event, no seam report).
 *   4. Module data events are emitted from the effective changes with
 *      `remote: true` (so the SyncManager never re-records inbound changes),
 *      carrying accurate `oldRow` before-images and derived `changedColumns`.
 *   5. After all tables' storage writes, ONE seam call reports the
 *      accumulated effective changes: `db.ingestExternalRowChanges(batch,
 *      { applyForeignKeyActions, assertionFailureMode: 'report' })` — capture +
 *      MV facets default on, commit-time global assertions in REPORT mode (a
 *      violation is collected into the result and the batch still commits).
 *      Changes recorded in `result.errors` are excluded from the batch.
 *
 * Snapshot bootstrap (per-call, not sticky): a known-complete wholesale load
 * defers MV maintenance and watch capture for the whole transfer and converges
 * once at the end.
 *   - `bootstrap` flush: steps 1–4 run unchanged (storage rows applied, remote
 *     module events emitted) but step 5 — the seam call — is SKIPPED. MV
 *     maintenance + capture are deferred to the finalize and FK actions are off
 *     for a wholesale load, so the only seam facet skipping the call drops
 *     outright is commit-time GLOBAL ASSERTION evaluation over the bootstrapped
 *     rows — deliberate under the seam's trust-the-origin contract. The
 *     incremental path enforces global assertions because it **merges** deltas
 *     from possibly many origins into the receiver's existing state, and a
 *     cross-origin merge can produce a global-invariant violation no single
 *     origin ever saw. Bootstrap does something different: it installs **one**
 *     origin's already-converged state **wholesale (replace, not merge)** — no
 *     merge means no merge-introduced violation, so a complete snapshot already
 *     satisfied the origin's assertions and re-checking is redundant. The
 *     `bootstrapFinalize` therefore does NOT evaluate any global assertion —
 *     not even a no-dependency one. This uniform skip is consistent with the
 *     seam's general trust-the-origin posture for every other constraint type
 *     (see `docs/mv-ingestion.md` § Trust boundary). MV-backed assertions
 *     would see the MV only after `refreshAllMaterializedViews()`; under
 *     trust-the-origin they are not evaluated at finalize at all, so MV-refresh
 *     ordering is moot for assertions. Residual risk (a corrupt/hostile snapshot
 *     installs invariant-violating data) is already unguarded for every other
 *     constraint type; a one-off assertion sweep would be inconsistent
 *     defense-in-depth — a separate integrity layer is the right fix if origins
 *     are ever distrusted. Per-flush evaluation also could not serve bootstrap
 *     correctly: it could spuriously fail a valid snapshot whose cross-table
 *     assertion sees children before parents. The remaining seam work for a
 *     wholesale load is otherwise deferred, so skipping the call also removes
 *     the per-flush transaction/savepoint and the per-flush full-rebuild.
 *   - `bootstrapFinalize` call (empty data/schema): converges every MV in
 *     dependency order via `db.refreshAllMaterializedViews()`, then fires a
 *     coarse `db.notifyExternalChange` per bootstrapped base table and per
 *     refreshed MV — one whole-table watch invalidation instead of per-row
 *     capture. The caller issues it before clearing the snapshot checkpoint, so
 *     a finalize throw leaves the checkpoint in place and the transfer retries.
 *
 * Inbound assertion violations are DETECT-AND-NOTIFY, not throw. Under the
 * seam's trust-the-origin contract the merged data must land regardless, so a
 * **local** commit-time global assertion can only usefully *notify*: the seam
 * runs in report mode, so a violation is collected and RETURNED in
 * `result.assertionViolations` while the batch commits — the derived effects
 * (MV backing deltas, capture entries) for the violating row land on the FIRST
 * attempt, so an incremental MV / `Database.watch` subscriber stays consistent
 * with the base table and there is no divergence and no retry. The consumer
 * (admission.ts) surfaces each returned violation to the host as an
 * `onAssertionViolation` event; the host decides policy.
 *
 * A genuine per-change STORAGE failure is different and still aborts: the
 * adapter collects it in `result.errors` (it keeps applying other tables), and
 * the consumer treats any non-empty `errors` like a whole-batch throw — emit
 * `status:'error'`, leave CRDT metadata uncommitted, re-resolve next sync.
 * Re-application is idempotent (value-identical upserts suppress). "Orthogonal"
 * (above) means the two outcomes are independent facts, NOT that a co-occurring
 * violation is dropped: when ONE batch carries both a per-change error and a
 * reported violation, the violation's row already committed in report mode, so
 * the consumer surfaces the `onAssertionViolation` event BEFORE the per-change
 * abort throws (see admission.ts `applyDataToStore`). The abort still blocks the
 * metadata commit and the batch still re-resolves.
 *
 * Constraints (see docs/mv-ingestion.md § External row-change
 * ingestion): the callback is host-driven — never invoke it from within
 * statement execution or vtab callbacks (exec-mutex deadlock), and hosts
 * should not drive it while holding an open explicit transaction on `db`
 * (the seam would join that transaction, so a later rollback diverges
 * MV/capture state from the already-committed storage rows; recoverable via
 * MV refresh).

 * (fill a column's NULLs, then `set not null`, in one relay). Everything answered
 * true here is therefore applied AFTER the batch's row writes; everything else
 * keeps its pre-data position, because the batch's rows may need the new shape to
 * land in. See {@link partitionSchemaChanges} for how the answer is used.
 *
 * The validating set is deliberately narrow — only alterations that INSPECT
 * existing rows without changing how those rows are stored or addressed:
 *
 * - `alter column … set not null` (`drop not null` loosens, so it stays early)
 * - `add constraint` — all three forms scan existing rows and throw on a
 *   violation: the module scans for `unique` and foreign-key, the engine scans for
 *   `check` before dispatching to the module.
 * - a UNIQUE `add_index` — verified to throw `UNIQUE constraint failed` against
 *   pre-existing duplicates, the same failure mode as `set not null`. A NON-unique
 *   index create inspects nothing, so it stays early.
 *
 * Two alterations look like they belong here and deliberately do NOT:
 *
 * - `alter primary key` — re-keying is not merely validating. The batch's row
 *   changes carry primary-key values and the key definition in force decides how
 *   those rows are ADDRESSED, so applying it after the rows would file them under
 *   the old key. It stays early, and its own tightening failure mode (duplicate
 *   values under the new key, arriving with the rows that resolve them) therefore
 *   remains.
 * - `alter column … set data type` — a type change rewrites stored values, so
 *   rows applied before it would be stored under the OLD type and then converted,
 *   which is not the same history the origin has. Stays early, same tradeoff.
 *
 * A migration whose DDL does not parse classifies non-validating: it keeps
 * today's position, and {@link decideAlterTable} logs the parse failure when it

 * merge onto the pre-read existing row (UPSERT semantics).
 *
 * "Net effect in order" is only correct on an HLC-ORDERED list, and

 * establishes that order: `change-applicator.ts`'s `orderDataChangesByHLC` sorts the
 * reconciled batch by HLC — in the one place that still holds the HLCs — before
 * handing it to `applyToStore`, so this collapse decides the same question by the
 * same rule as resolution and the in-batch delete reconciliation, whatever order the
 * batch arrived in. Anything else driving this callback owes it the same ordering.
