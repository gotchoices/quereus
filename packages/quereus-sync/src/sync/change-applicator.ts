 * deliberately conservative over-estimate that errs toward RETAINING storage
 * (under-counting would risk a premature drop). A `directly-mapped` table (the
 * local peer still maps it) is ordinary sync traffic, not a retirement signal —
 * skipped, so the common pre-migration case touches nothing.
 *
 * Cheap in the common case: one bounded `getAll` scan, and an immediate return
 * when no lifecycle records exist. Batched — one KV update per touched table, not
 * per change. Advisory: a failure is logged and swallowed so it can never abort
 * the apply (the next inbound write re-bumps the clock).
