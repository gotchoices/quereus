/**
 * Query-rewrite matcher — the read-side dual of the coverage prover. It
 * recognizes when an *arbitrary* scan-projection-filter query fragment (one that
 * never names a materialized view) is **answered from** a covering MV, so the
 * optimizer can scan the MV's backing table with a bounded residual instead of
 * recomputing the body against the base tables.
 *
 * Distinct from `coverage-prover.ts` (which proves a *base-table UNIQUE
 * constraint* is covered, on the write/enforcement path) but sharing its
 * entailment vocabulary: `recognizeConjunctiveClauses` / `guardClausesEntail`
 * (`partial-unique-extraction.ts`). The question answered here is **output-relation
 * subsumption**: does the MV's stored output relation contain a superset (re-
 * coverable via a bounded residual) of the rows the fragment produces, keyed so
 * the residual recovers exactly the fragment's output?
 *
 * Soundness contract (mirrors the coverage prover exactly): **a false NotMatch
 * only forgoes a speedup; a false Match returns wrong rows.** Every check forgoes
 * the rewrite on doubt. The pre-existing recompute-over-base path is correct by
 * construction; the rule only ever replaces it with a provably row-equivalent
 * plan, so the rewrite is non-regressing.
 *
 * This phase delivers the **projection + filter subsumption** shape only.
 * Aggregate rollup (`mv-query-rewrite-aggregate-rollup`) and join subsumption
 * (`mv-query-rewrite-join-subsumption`) are pure additions to this matcher.
 *
 * ## Where the predicates come from (the pristine-fragment requirement)
 *
 * The fragment's WHERE is read from the live plan's `FilterNode` predicate (its
 * `.expression` AST), and the MV's WHERE from `mv.selectAst.where`. Reading the
 * fragment WHERE from the plan is only sound while the predicate is still an
 * explicit `FilterNode` above the table access — *before* predicate-pushdown
 * absorbs it into a range-bounded scan (where the matcher could no longer see it
 * and would falsely treat the fragment as unfiltered). The rule that drives this
 * matcher therefore fires in the **Structural rewrite pass, before grow-retrieve /
 * predicate-pushdown**, where the fragment is the pristine
 * `Project(Filter?(Retrieve(TableReference)))`. The shape walk additionally
 * rejects any range-bounded physical scan (`SeqScan`/`IndexScan` with
 * `rangeBoundedOn`, or an `IndexSeek`/`TableSeek`) as `'shape'` — defense in depth
 * should an absorbed predicate ever reach the walk by another path.
 *
 * ## Why `.expression` recognition is sound under constant folding
 *
 * A scalar plan node retains its originating AST in `.expression`. Constant
 * folding (which runs before the Structural pass) may make the *plan* more
 * specific than its `.expression` (e.g. folding `1+1` → `2` while `.expression`
 * still reads `amt > 1+1`). Such a divergence only ever makes a clause
 * *unrecognized* (`literalValue` of a non-literal AST returns undefined), which is
 * a conservative NotMatch — it never fabricates a recognized clause weaker than
 * what the plan computes, so it cannot produce a false Match.

 * row-preserving inner/cross-join MV body (`mv-query-rewrite-join-subsumption`),
 * and answer it from the MV's backing table (eliminating the join at read time).
 *
 * The hard soundness question — "does this join contribute exactly one row per
 * governed `T` row?" — is the coverage prover's shared `proveOneToOneJoin`
 * (no-row-loss descent + `proveJoinNoFanout`). A 1:1 join's output relation is in
 * bijection with `T`'s governed rows, so two 1:1 joins over the *same tables, same
 * equi-pairs, same join type* produce the same row set. This arm therefore proves
 * both the **fragment's** join and the **MV body's** join are 1:1 over the same
 * `(T, lookup, type, equi-pairs)`, then reuses the foundation's projection /
 * residual subsumption over the joined output relation.
 *
 * The MV body is supplied as its already-optimized relational root (the rule plans
 * it once, suppressed, and caches it) so `proveOneToOneJoin` runs against the same
 * shape the create-time `'join-residual'` gate proved.
 *
 * Read-side relaxation: a join MV body carries **no WHERE** (the row-time
 * `'join-residual'` create gate rejects a partial join body), so predicate
 * entailment is trivial — every fragment WHERE conjunct is residual. Unlike the
 * row-time arm, a WHERE term on a *lookup-side* column is fine here: we are only
 * *reading* the already-materialized join, so the residual filters the stored
 * joined rows directly.
