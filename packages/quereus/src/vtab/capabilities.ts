/**
 * How a module's DDL (schema-change) statements behave with respect to the
 * enclosing transaction. A single worst-case summary across every DDL statement
 * the module can execute — per-statement detail belongs in the backend docs, not
 * this flag. Severity order (least → most surprising):
 *
 *  - `'transactional'` — the reference semantics: a schema change is part of the
 *    enclosing transaction. The catalog entry and physical structures are buffered
 *    with the transaction, visible to later statements inside it, made durable
 *    atomically with the DML at commit, and discarded whole on `rollback` /
 *    `rollback to savepoint`. No built-in module reaches this tier today.
 *  - `'non-transactional'` — the schema change escapes the transaction (it survives
 *    `rollback`) but buffered DML still rolls back normally. This is the memory
 *    module, and the store's non-committing DDL statements.
 *  - `'auto-commit'` — executing certain DDL commits the module's buffered
 *    transaction at DDL time: the schema change AND every buffered write become
 *    durable immediately, and a later `rollback` undoes nothing. This is the store
 *    module (its row-rewriting ALTER arms and `renameTable` flush pending ops).
 *
 * A module declares its WORST case: the store does both non-transactional and
 * auto-committing DDL, so it declares `'auto-commit'`.
 *
 * Consumed by the `ddl_transaction_policy = 'strict'` gate, which refuses a
 * module-dispatching DDL statement inside an explicit transaction on any module
 * whose tier is not `'transactional'`. See `runtime/emit/ddl-transaction-policy.ts`
 * and docs/module-capabilities.md § "DDL transactionality tiers".
