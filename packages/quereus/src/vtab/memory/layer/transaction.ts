	/**
	 * Adopts a schema change that was applied to the table while THIS layer's transaction

	 * Three kinds of change reach here:
	 *
	 *  - **Additive** (`create index` / `create unique index` / `add constraint … unique`):
	 *    a name absent from {@link secondaryIndexes} is built and added. Without it, a layer
	 *    created before the DDL keeps its creation-time schema: it has neither the new
	 *    `IndexSchema` (so an index scan raises "Secondary index not found") nor the derived
	 *    `uniqueConstraints` entry (so `checkUniqueConstraints` silently skips it and a
	 *    colliding insert is accepted).
	 *  - **Re-keying** (`alter column … set collate`): an index whose `IndexSchema` object
	 *    is no longer the one this layer holds is REPLACED. `BaseLayer.rebuildAllSecondaryIndexes`
	 *    hands every index a fresh BTree under the new collation, so a layer that kept its old
	 *    `MemoryIndex` would go on comparing under the old collation over an orphaned tree —
	 *    and, once it becomes the committed head at commit, would shadow the base's rebuilt
	 *    structures entirely.
	 *  - **Removal** (`drop index` / `drop constraint`): an index whose name the new schema no
	 *    longer declares is DROPPED from {@link secondaryIndexes}. Without it the layer keeps the
	 *    derived `uniqueConstraints` entry in its frozen schema and goes on enforcing a constraint
	 *    that no longer exists, and an index scan can still reach the orphaned tree via
	 *    {@link getSecondaryIndexTree}. An empty/undefined `newSchema.indexes` drops all of them.
	 *    Like the additive side, a removal is NOT undone by `rollback to savepoint`: every layer in
	 *    the chain adopts it, so the restored snapshot has the index dropped too (DDL is not
	 *    transactional here — see `feat-ddl-transaction-capability`).
	 *
	 * An index is considered unchanged only when the NEW schema's `IndexSchema` is the very
	 * object the old schema carried. Every DDL path that re-keys rebuilds those objects, and
	 * every additive path preserves them, so identity is the exact discriminator.
	 *
	 * The caller MUST apply this to a whole parent chain oldest-first: each layer builds its
	 * `MemoryIndex` over its parent's tree for that index, so the parent's must already be the
	 * new one. Only the layer's OWN writes are re-indexed — everything below is inherited
	 * copy-on-write, exactly as {@link initializeSecondaryIndexes} does at construction.
	 *
	 * Never applied to a column-set or primary-key change: either would invalidate
	 * {@link pkFunctions} and the primary tree. A PK-column collation change goes to
	 * {@link rekeyPrimaryKey} instead, and `ensureSchemaChangeSafety` raises BUSY when any
	 * connection other than the DDL issuer holds a pending layer.

	 * {@link pkFunctions}, the primary tree, and every secondary index (each of which derives
	 * its `primaryKeyComparator` / `encode` from the PK definition), so nothing this layer owns
	 * survives the ALTER still keyed under the old collation.
	 *
	 * Like {@link adoptSchema}, the caller MUST apply this to a whole parent chain oldest-first
	 * (base layer already re-keyed): the new tree inherits copy-on-write from the parent's new
	 * one, so the parent's must already exist.
	 *
	 * ### Why {@link ownWrites} is rewritten to its net effect
	 *
	 * `ownWrites` is an ordered log that may touch one key repeatedly, and under the new
	 * comparator two keys that were distinct in that log can collapse into one. Replaying it
	 * verbatim would let a later write land on an earlier write's row, or a deletion remove a
	 * row a subsequent upsert had already placed. So the log is REWRITTEN here, in place, to
	 * one entry per key: the layer's effective row (read out of the pre-rekey tree), or a
	 * deletion — deletions first, and a deletion whose key an upsert now occupies is dropped
	 * entirely. The rewritten log is what every later reader of it replays: this method's own
	 * index rebuild, a `create index` later in the same transaction ({@link adoptSchema} →
	 * {@link reindexOwnWrites}), and `MemoryTableManager.commitTransaction`'s rebase.
	 *
	 * Soundness rests on a precondition `MemoryTableManager.validateRekeyedPrimaryKey` enforces
	 * before any of this runs: NO layer in the chain — base included — holds two rows that
	 * collide under the new comparator. Given that, every key here resolves to at most one row
	 * in the parent, so a deletion removes exactly the row this layer removed and an upsert
	 * lands at exactly one key.
	 *
	 * NOTE: the deletion replay assumes a key this layer deleted was a key the PARENT held.
	 * That holds because every DML operation gets its own layer (`MemoryTableConnection`'s
	 * statement savepoints), so no layer both creates and destroys a key. If a single layer
	 * ever does, `rekeyed.find(key)` can land on a *colliding* parent row and delete it: at
	 * that point the deletion needs to verify, under the OLD comparator, that the row it found
	 * is the row it removed.
