/**
 * Materialized-view maintenance: schema-change staleness tracking plus row-time
 * write-through maintenance.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 *  1. **Staleness** — a *schema* change to a source table (drop / alter) can break
 *     an MV's body. This manager subscribes to schema-change events and marks any
 *     MV whose body reads a modified/removed source `stale`. The next reference
 *     re-validates the body (erroring with the staleness diagnostic on an
 *     incompatible change); the next successful refresh clears the flag. One
 *     carve-out: a **body-irrelevant** `table_modified` (constraint/stats/tags-only —
 *     columns and physical PK identical, see `isBodyIrrelevantTableChange`) instead
 *     RECOMPILES each live dependent's row-time plan in place
 *     (`tryRecompileMaterializedViewLive`, gated by shape re-derivation), falling
 *     back to mark-stale on any failure — so DROP/ADD/RENAME CONSTRAINT and ANALYZE
 *     no longer de-liven dependents whose backing shape is unaffected. The SAME
 *     subscription also rebuilds a maintained table's compiled **derived-row
 *     constraint validator** when a *constraint-only* dependency — an FK parent or a
 *     subquery-CHECK target, neither a derivation source — is renamed/dropped/re-created
 *     (see {@link MaterializedViewManager.rebuildConstraintValidatorsFor}); without
 *     this the validator, compiled once at registration, would keep resolving against
 *     the dead/renamed incarnation and fail maintenance writes with an internal
 *     module-connect error.
 *
 *  2. **Row-time write-through** (`maintainRowTime`) — the backing table is kept
 *     consistent *synchronously* with each source row-write, driven from the
 *     runtime DML boundary (not at COMMIT). Each MV's maintenance is **cost-gated with a
 *     floor**: the builder matches the body to a bounded-delta arm (the covering-index
 *     inverse projection, an aggregate / lateral-TVF / 1:1-join residual) when one fits —
 *     each source row then maps to a bounded backing delta, no full scan — and otherwise
 *     falls through to the always-correct **full-rebuild floor** (re-evaluate the whole
 *     body, replace the backing). **No body is rejected for its shape;** the only
 *     create-time rejections are non-shape (non-determinism, bag/no-key, no relational
 *     output, and a full-rebuild-only body over a source past the size threshold). The
 *     write targets the backing table's *pending* transaction layer through the same
 *     connection a `select` from the MV uses, so the change is visible mid-transaction
 *     (reads-own-writes) and is committed/rolled-back in lockstep with the source write by
 *     the coordinated commit (see {@link MaterializedViewManager.buildMaintenancePlan}).

	 * change invalidates it without this emit — verified by the regression suite, which

	 * maps `table_*` → `'table'` and matches on type + objectName (+ optional schemaName)
	 * only, ignoring the payload, so the maintained `TableSchema` is passed as both old/new.
	 *
	 * **Same-object payload contract (load-bearing coupling).** Passing the SAME object

	 * Safety: the event names the maintained table itself, which is never in its OWN

	/**
	 * Build the backing-PK equality prefix for a covering-conflict scan, or
	 * `undefined` to fall back to the full backing scan.
	 *
	 * The covering-index shape guarantees the body's `order by` columns are a
	 * permutation of the UC columns and that they seed the leading backing-PK columns
	 * (`computeBackingPrimaryKey`). So the leading `k = uc.columns.length` backing-PK
	 * columns are exactly the UC columns (as a set, possibly reordered by `order by`).
	 * The returned prefix is keyed in **backing-PK column order** (not `uc.columns`
	 * order), so a permuting `order by` still seeks to the right block:
	 * `prefix[i] = newRow[ sourceCol(backingPkDefinition[i]) ]`.
	 *
	 * Returns `undefined` (full-scan fallback) when any holds:
	 *  - fewer than `k` backing-PK columns, or a leading column is not a passthrough
	 *    of a source column (defensive — the covering shape guarantees passthrough);
	 *  - the leading `k` backing-PK columns do not map to **exactly** the UC
	 *    source-column set (defensive guard against a non-UC-leading structure);
	 *  - any leading backing-PK column, or its source UC column, has a **non-BINARY**
	 *    collation. This is a *soundness* gate, not a perf choice: the prefix seek's
	 *    early-termination compares with plain `compareSqlValues` (binary), while the
	 *    backing btree orders the PK by its declared collation and the UNIQUE
	 *    constraint conflicts by the source collation. Under a non-binary collation
	 *    the binary early-termination could `break` before a collated-equal /
	 *    binary-different conflict, missing it. The full-scan fallback re-compares
	 *    with the source collation, so it stays collation-correct.
	 *
	 * DESC-leading prefixes are admitted: equality on a column makes its order
	 * direction irrelevant to *grouping* (the binary-equal rows stay contiguous), and
	 * `scanLayer`'s `equalityPrefix` seek + ascending walk lands at the group start
	 * for either direction (verified by the `order by … desc` enforcement test).
