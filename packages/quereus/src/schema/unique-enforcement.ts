/**
 * Shared UNIQUE-enforcement collation helpers. {@link uniqueEnforcementCollations}
 * is the single source of truth across packages — it is re-exported from the
 * package index (`@quereus/quereus`) and imported directly by the store and
 * isolation re-validators (`quereus-store/store-table.ts`,
 * `quereus-isolation/isolated-table.ts`), so cross-package drift is eliminated by
 * construction rather than by a test.
 *
 * Two facts about a UNIQUE constraint that both the row-time covering-MV
 * eligibility gate and memory's covering-MV re-validation need:
 *
 *  - {@link uniqueEnforcementCollations} — the comparison collation per
 *    constrained column. For an index-derived constraint
 *    (`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX … (col COLLATE x)`) it is the index's per-column
 *    COLLATE (resolved BY NAME via `uc.derivedFromIndex`); otherwise the declared
 *    column collation. Positional alignment `uc.columns[i]` ↔ `index.columns[i]`
 *    is guaranteed by `appendIndexToTableSchema`.
 *
 *    Memory's `checkUniqueViaIndex` (manager.ts) is the one resolver that does NOT
 *    import this helper: it reads the collation from the *live* `MemoryIndex`
 *    handle that `findIndexForConstraint` resolves BY COLUMN-SET, a source this
 *    `(schema, uc)` signature has no handle to. For the normal shape — at most one
 *    UNIQUE index per column-set — the two index-resolution paths land on the same
 *    index and the same per-column collations, so it is conformance-locked against
 *    this helper by `test/unique-enforcement-collation.spec.ts` rather than sharing
 *    the import. (They DIVERGE when two UNIQUE indexes cover the same column-set
 *    with different collations — memory then enforces the first index's collation
 *    for both UCs and can under-enforce a coarser-declared one; a pre-existing
 *    memory-enforcement bug tracked by fix ticket
 *    `memory-multi-index-unique-collation-resolution`, NOT introduced here.)
 *
 *  - {@link coveringMvHonorsIndexCollation} — whether a row-time covering MV may
 *    soundly answer this constraint. A covering MV generates its candidate set by
 *    re-comparing each backing row under the SOURCE column's DECLARED collation
 *    `D`, while the re-validators filter under the index per-column collation `I`.
 *    The candidate set is therefore a sound *superset* of the `I`-matches — safe
 *    to filter down — iff, per column, `D ⊒ I` (every `I`-equal pair is also
 *    `D`-equal). Two name-only tests prove `D ⊒ I` without a collation lattice
 *    (collations are opaque comparators):
 *      - `I` normalizes to BINARY — BINARY equality is byte-identity, and every
 *        comparator returns 0 for byte-identical inputs (reflexivity), so
 *        byte-identical ⊆ `D`-equal for any `D` (the finer-index case).
 *      - `D == I` (normalized names equal) — trivially `D`-equal == `I`-equal
 *        (the common case, incl. every non-derived UNIQUE where `I` falls back
 *        to `D`).
 *    Otherwise (`I` non-BINARY and ≠ `D`) the candidate set may be a *subset* and
 *    the MV must not be used as a covering structure — the per-scan / auto-index
 *    path (already index-collation-correct) enforces instead. This under-claims
 *    safely: an exotic custom pair where `D ⊒ I` holds semantically but neither
 *    test fires is declined (perf-only loss in an already-exotic shape).
