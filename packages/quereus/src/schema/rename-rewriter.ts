/**
 * In-place, scope-aware AST rewriters over schema-object expressions: the
 * rename walkers propagate ALTER TABLE RENAME operations into dependent
 * objects (CHECK expressions, view SELECT bodies, etc.), and the
 * self-qualifier strip folds a schema-authored row expression's
 * table-qualified self-references (a CHECK's or a GENERATED ALWAYS AS body's)
 * so the row-context scope it is compiled against can resolve them.
 *
 * The walkers live in `rename/`, split along their seams — table
 * rename (`rename/table-rename.ts`), column rename
 * (`rename/column-rename.ts`), self-qualifier strip and its own-row
 * requalifying twin (`rename/self-qualifier-strip.ts`) — over the shared
 * vocabulary in `rename/shared.ts`. This module re-exports the public surface so callers
 * keep one import path.
