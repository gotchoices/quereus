	 * applied, so a failure in B leaves A committed. See the fix ticket and
	 * `quereus-store/README` § "Atomic multi-store commit".
	 *
	 * Phase 1 (apply): for every staged overlay, begin its underlying table and
	 * apply the overlay's rows WITHOUT committing (see {@link applyOverlayToUnderlying}).
	 * For a `quereus-store` underlying, every table's writes accumulate in the
	 * module's single shared coordinator (the first `begin()` opens it; the rest are
	 * idempotent no-ops).
	 *
	 * Phase 2 (commit): once ALL overlays have applied, commit the affected
	 * underlying tables. For `quereus-store` the first `commit()` flushes every
	 * table's ops in one atomic coordinator commit — a single `AtomicBatch.write()`
	 * on a provider that exposes `beginAtomicBatch` — and the rest no-op. For an
	 * underlying with per-table transaction domains (the memory vtab), each table
	 * commits independently.
	 *
	 * On any Phase-1 error, roll back every underlying begun so far and rethrow;
	 * nothing was committed, so the transaction aborts atomically. Because all the
	 * fallible data work (constraint re-checks, injected/IO write errors) happens in
	 * Phase 1 before any commit, a data-driven abort is always clean. Full
	 * crash-atomicity across the commit phase itself is contingent on the underlying
	 * exposing a shared atomic commit domain (see docs/design-isolation-layer.md
	 * § "Commit Failure Recovery").
	 *
	 * A poisoned overlay aborts the whole commit before any apply — mirroring the
	 * per-connection `assertOverlayUsable` check, now with the added benefit that no earlier
	 * table is left committed. The overlay is left intact so the ensuing rollback discards
	 * it. Two DDLs poison: a cross-connection ALTER (rows left in the pre-alter layout) and
	 * a cross-connection DROP TABLE (the table is gone; see {@link destroy}).
	 *
	 * Driven once per db-transaction: the first `IsolatedConnection.commit()` in the
	 * database's commit loop runs this whole flush and clears every overlay, so the
	 * remaining connections find no overlay for their table and this is a no-op — no
	 * explicit "already flushed" latch is needed, the cleared-overlay state guards
	 * itself.
	 *
	 * **Invariant: every staged overlay resolves to an underlying table here, or is
	 * poisoned.** The table-lifecycle hooks are what keep that true — {@link destroy}
	 * discards or poisons the overlays of a dropped table across every connection, and
	 * {@link renameTable} re-connects the underlying under the new name whenever it re-keys
	 * an overlay onto it. The poison check above is the enforcement point: it runs BEFORE
	 * the `underlyingTables` lookup, so a dropped table's surviving foreign overlay raises
	 * its poison message rather than the orphan error below. A miss that is neither resolved
	 * nor poisoned is therefore a layer-invariant violation, not a routine condition, and is
	 * raised as `StatusCode.INTERNAL`: the alternative — dropping the staged rows and letting
	 * the commit report success — is silent data loss. Only a CLEAN overlay

	 *
	 * `preOverlaySavepoints` is swept for every matching key whose overlay did NOT survive.
	 * A surviving poisoned overlay keeps its set: `ensureOverlay` padding still consults it,
	 * and the owning connection's `onConnectionRollback` reaps it when its failed commit
	 * rolls back. Without the sweep, an abandoned set outlived the table for the lifetime of
	 * the `Database` (nothing else is keyed to reap it once the table is gone).
	 *
	 * Nothing is discarded or poisoned until the underlying destroy SUCCEEDS. A throwing
	 * `underlying.destroy` means the table still exists, so every connection's staged
	 * writes are still flushable and every map entry must survive untouched — the same
	 * reason {@link renameTable} delegates before mutating its maps.
	 *
	 * NOTE: poison rides on the `ConnectionOverlayState`, not on its rows, so a foreign
	 * connection that later unwinds every staged row past the drop (rollback to a savepoint
	 * taken after the overlay existed) still fails its commit. Deliberately over-strict —
	 * the table is gone either way. If a caller ever needs the clean-unwind case to commit,
	 * re-evaluate the poison on `onConnectionRollbackToSavepoint` rather than special-casing
	 * here.
	 *
	 * NOTE: a connection whose own overlay was already poisoned (by another connection's
	 * ALTER) escapes that poison for this table by dropping it — the own-overlay branch
	 * deletes the state, poison and all. Correct as written: the rows it discards belong to
	 * a table this connection just asked to remove. If poison ever carries a cause that
	 * outlives the table, gate the own-overlay delete on it.
	 *
	 * NOTE: this mutates `connectionOverlays` while a foreign connection may be mid-scan in
	 * `IsolatedTable.query`'s merged branch — that scan will keep merging against an overlay
	 * whose underlying is now destroyed. The module clamps to `'reentrant-reads'`, so no

	 *   rows short-circuit to `null` (the evaluator never runs), and a NOT-NULL-violating
	 *   evaluated row throws CONSTRAINT here, atomically. Computed values are discarded.
	 *
	 * For `set not null` with NO usable DEFAULT (`setNotNullCtx.hasDefault === false`), a staged
	 * non-tombstone NULL at the now-NOT-NULL column throws CONSTRAINT here — for the issuer this
	 * aborts atomically before the underlying mutates; for a foreign overlay the caller maps it to
	 * poison. With a usable DEFAULT the staged NULLs are backfilled by {@link translateOverlayRow},
	 * so nothing is rejected here.
	 *
	 * Non-addColumn / non-tightening changes (`addColumnCtx === undefined` and no reject-mode
	 * `setNotNullCtx`) only run the tombstone guard; their row translation appends/removes nothing
	 * fallible on data grounds.
