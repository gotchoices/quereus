# Virtual Table Module Authoring Guide

> **Stability: Stable** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

This guide provides documentation for implementing virtual table modules in Quereus. It covers the architecture, optimization integration, and best practices for module authors.

## Topic documents

This document is the **hub**: the retrieve boundary, the capability APIs in outline, transaction support, schema-change handling, and the mutation surface. The subsystems large enough to read on their own live in the topic documents below.

<!-- NOTE: a section that moved into a satellite left a one-line stub behind under its original
     heading, so its old anchor still resolves here. `yarn docs:check` therefore cannot tell a
     link deliberately left on a stub from one that should have been retargeted and was not.
     When linking real content that lives in a satellite, link the satellite — not the stub. -->

## Overview

Virtual table modules are the primary extension point for custom data sources in Quereus. A module implements the `VirtualTableModule` interface and provides instances of `VirtualTable` that handle data access, updates, and query optimization.

### Key Concepts

- **Module**: Factory that creates table instances; implements `create()`, `connect()`, and optimization methods
- **Table Instance**: Represents a specific table; implements `query()`, `update()`, and transaction support
- **Optimization Integration**: Modules communicate capabilities to the optimizer via `BestAccessPlan` API or `supports()` method
- **Retrieve Boundary**: The optimizer wraps all table references in `RetrieveNode`, marking where data transitions from module execution to Quereus execution

## Architecture: Retrieve-Based Push-down

### The Retrieve Node Boundary

Every table reference is automatically wrapped in a `RetrieveNode` at build time:

```
RetrieveNode (optimizer boundary)
  └─ pipeline: RelationalPlanNode (module-supported operations)
      └─ TableReferenceNode (leaf table reference)
```

**Key principle**: Operations inside the `RetrieveNode` pipeline are executed by the module; operations above are executed by Quereus.

### How Push-down Works

1. **Predicate Normalization**: The optimizer normalizes filter predicates and extracts constraints
2. **Supported-only Placement**: Only predicates the module can handle are pushed into the `Retrieve` pipeline
3. **Residual Predicates**: Unsupported predicates remain above the `Retrieve` boundary
4. **Binding Capture**: Parameters and correlated column references are captured in `Retrieve.bindings`

Example:
```sql
select * from users where id = 1 and name like 'A%' and age > 30;
```

If the module supports equality on `id` but not LIKE or range comparisons:
```
Filter (name LIKE 'A%' AND age > 30)  ← Quereus executes
  └─ Retrieve
      └─ Filter (id = 1)              ← Module executes
          └─ TableReference
```

### Retrieve Node Structure

The `RetrieveNode` contains:
- **pipeline**: The operations the module will execute (initially just `TableReferenceNode`, but grows as predicates are pushed down)
- **bindings**: Parameters and correlated column references captured from pushed-down operations

At runtime:
1. Bindings are evaluated to produce concrete values
2. The module receives these values via `FilterInfo.args` (for index-based) or as part of the plan (for query-based)
3. The module executes the pipeline and returns rows
4. Quereus applies any residual operations above the `Retrieve` boundary

### Supported-only Placement Policy

The optimizer enforces a strict policy: **only operations the module can handle are placed inside the Retrieve boundary**. This is determined by:

1. **For query-based modules**: The `supports()` method returns a result
2. **For index-based modules**: The `getBestAccessPlan()` method marks filters as handled via `handledFilters` array

If a module claims to handle an operation but fails at runtime, data corruption can result. Always be conservative in capability reporting. See *Claiming `handledFilters`* below for the exact per-column, per-role rule the planner applies.

## Module Capability APIs

Modules communicate their capabilities through two complementary interfaces:

### 1. Query-Based Push-down (Advanced)

Implement `supports()` to analyze entire query pipelines:

```typescript
interface VirtualTableModule {
  supports?(node: PlanNode): SupportAssessment | undefined;
}

interface SupportAssessment {
  cost: number;           // Module's cost estimate
  ctx?: unknown;          // Opaque context for runtime
}
```

**When to use**: SQL federation, document databases, remote APIs that can execute complex queries.

**Important**: If `supports()` returns a result, the module **must** implement `executePlan()` to execute the pipeline. The optimizer will call `executePlan()` at runtime with the same plan node and context.

**Example**: A PostgreSQL federation module analyzing a Filter+Project+Sort pipeline:
```typescript
supports(node: PlanNode): SupportAssessment | undefined {
  if (node instanceof FilterNode) {
    // Check if predicate is SQL-compatible
    if (this.canTranslatePredicate(node.predicate)) {
      return { cost: 10, ctx: { sql: this.generateSQL(node) } };
    }
  }
  return undefined; // Can't handle this pipeline
}

// At runtime, executePlan() receives the same node and ctx
async* executePlan(db: Database, node: PlanNode, ctx?: unknown): AsyncIterable<Row> {
  const sql = (ctx as any)?.sql;
  // Execute the SQL against the remote database
  const results = await this.executeRemoteSQL(sql);
  for (const row of results) {
    yield row;
  }
}
```

### 2. Index-Based Access (Standard)

> **Invariant:** [OPT-060](invariants.md#opt-060--an-ordering-claim-over-a-descending-key-column-excludes-nulls)

Implement `getBestAccessPlan()` to expose index capabilities:

```typescript
interface VirtualTableModule {
  getBestAccessPlan?(
    db: Database,
    tableInfo: TableSchema,
    request: BestAccessPlanRequest
  ): BestAccessPlanResult;
}

interface BestAccessPlanRequest {
  columns: readonly ColumnMeta[];
  filters: readonly PredicateConstraint[];
  requiredOrdering?: OrderingSpec;
  limit?: number | null;   // present ONLY when stopping early is provably safe — see below
  offset?: number | null;  // travels with `limit`; the bound is `limit + offset`
  estimatedRows?: number;
}
```

**It is called more than once per statement, so keep it pure and cheap.** Planning probes the
same table several times with different requests and keeps only the answer it wants: the
retrieve-growth rule asks once for the plan it is considering, re-asks without `limit` when the
limit turns out not to be truncation-safe, and asks a third time with `filters`, `requiredOrdering`,
`limit` and `offset` all stripped to get the whole-table baseline it compares that plan against
(`baselineScanCost`, see [Optimizer costing § Where a module's own size fits](optimizer-costing.md)).
A discarded probe must leave nothing behind — no cursor opened, no cache mutated, no counter
advanced — and asking about a filter-free request must be as cheap as asking about a filtered one.
A module that cannot answer cheaply should memoize its own answer; the engine does not memoize for
you.

**`limit` is a licence, not a hint.** When it is present the engine has already proven
that nothing between your scan and the `LIMIT` can discard a row, so you may both price
against it and truncate to it. When it cannot prove that, the field is *absent* rather
than advisory — there is no "limit you should ignore". Two rules follow:

- The bound is `limit + offset`, never `limit` alone. The engine's `LimitOffsetNode` still
  discards `offset` rows above whatever you emit, so stopping at `limit` underproduces.
- Apply it only to a candidate that **provides the requested ordering**, and only when
  that candidate **claims every filter**. A plan that provides no ordering gets a Sort
  above it, which drains its input before emitting anything; a plan that leaves a filter
  in the residual gets a `Filter` above it, which can reject rows you already produced. If
  you price *some* candidates against the bound and not others, you have not made your
  cost model more accurate — you have put a thumb on the scale between them.

`StoreModule` does exactly this in `rowsToProduce`
(`packages/quereus-store/src/common/store-module-access-plan.ts`), applied uniformly to
its seek arms, its ordering walk, and its full scan.

```typescript
interface BestAccessPlanResult {
  handledFilters: readonly boolean[];  // Which filters the module handles
  cost: number;                        // Cost estimate
  rows: number | undefined;            // Cardinality ESTIMATE, never a proof
  provablyEmpty?: boolean;             // Proof that nothing can match the claimed filters
  providesOrdering?: readonly OrderingSpec[]; // If module provides ordering
  indexName?: string;                  // Name of the chosen index ('_primary_' or a secondary)
  indexDescriptor?: IndexDescriptor;   // Structured identity of that index (see below)
  seekColumnIndexes?: readonly number[]; // Columns forming the seek key
  isSet?: boolean;                     // If result is guaranteed unique
  explains?: string;                   // Free-text explanation for debugging
  residualFilter?: (row: any) => boolean; // Optional JS filter for residual predicates

  // Optional monotonic-storage advertisements. The optimizer lifts these onto
  // the physical leaf node's `physical.monotonicOn` / `physical.accessCapabilities`
  // and downstream rules use them to license rewrites that depend on
  // total-order emit (streaming asof, monotonic merge join, ordinal-seek
  // pushdown). Not propagated through pass-through nodes.
  monotonicOn?: { columnIndex: number; direction: 'asc' | 'desc'; strict: boolean };
  supportsOrdinalSeek?: boolean;       // Implies monotonicOn; O(log N) seek to kth row
  supportsAsofRight?: boolean;         // Implies monotonicOn; forward-only repositioning
}
```

**Capability contracts**:
- `providesOrdering` must carry each key column's *actual* emit direction. A key declared `PRIMARY KEY (id DESC)` is walked descending, so its spec is `desc: true` — advertising `desc: false` over it lets the merge-join rule skip the Sort it needs, and the join silently drops rows. Derive the flag from the column definition (`desc: !!col.desc`); never hard-code it.
- **`providesOrdering` also claims NULL placement, and the engine's placement is absolute.** `ORDER BY` puts NULLs FIRST for *both* directions (`orderByNullResult`, `util/comparison.ts`), while a reversed key walk emits them LAST — inverting the bytes sends the NULL tag to the end. Do not re-derive the rule: `nullSafeOrderingPrefixLength(tableInfo, request, keyColumns, orderPreservingPrefix, pinnedCols)` is exported from `@quereus/quereus` and is what both shipped backends use. Notes on calling it:
  - `keyColumns` is an `IndexColumnSchema[]`, so an index's `columns` and a table's `primaryKeyDefinition` both go in unchanged — **a nullable descending primary-key member is exposed by the same reasoning, with no `CREATE INDEX` involved.**
  - Truncating the returned prefix is the general form. A caller that claims a required ordering verbatim (all or nothing) wants the boolean `nullSafeOrderingPrefixLength(…) === matchedLength` instead.
  - Gate **every** claim, not only the one a `requiredOrdering` asked for: a bare advertisement made with no request is read by the merge-join rule under the same NULLs-first rule, and a `monotonicOn` `direction: 'desc'` (plus `supportsAsofRight`, which implies it) asserts the same physical order.
- `monotonicOn` is the leaf's natural emit order (storage property, not request-dependent). Stronger than `providesOrdering` — implies a total order with no gaps in coverage.
- `supportsOrdinalSeek` enables the `monotonic-limit-pushdown` rule: when advertised, the runtime may stamp `FilterInfo.offset`/`FilterInfo.limit` and the module must seek directly to the kth monotonic row (see `query()` contract above). Modules that advertise `supportsOrdinalSeek` but ignore the directives at runtime degrade to a streaming `LIMIT` (the rule's slice operator enforces the cap above the leaf).
- `supportsAsofRight` enables the `lateral-top1-asof` rule: forward-only repositioning per left row.

**Row counts — `rows` is an estimate, with no exception**:

`request.estimatedRows` is the planner's hint, populated only from `ANALYZE`-collected statistics; `undefined` means unknown, and a module that can size itself may substitute its own count there — but must defer to a supplied hint, or the access path is costed against a different figure than the plan around it. `rows` in the result is an estimate the engine costs with and nothing more — `rows: 0` is a very selective estimate, not an assertion about the result set, and the engine will still read your table and enforce the filters.

**Unknown is sent as unknown.** Every site in the planner that builds a request now sends `undefined` for a table nobody has analyzed — no site substitutes a placeholder row count of its own. So a self-sizing module is *expected* to fill the gap, and a module that cannot size itself must supply its own fallback (`request.estimatedRows ?? 1000` or whatever suits its storage), because nothing upstream will. Three spellings, all distinct: `undefined` is "nobody knows", `0` is "measured, and empty" (price against it — do **not** read it as unknown), and `n > 0` is a measurement to defer to. Use `??`, not `||`, when reading it, or a measured empty table silently becomes your default. `validateAccessPlanRequest` rejects a negative or non-integer `estimatedRows`; `undefined` and `0` both pass.

**`provablyEmpty` is the proof channel.** Set it only when your module has *proven* that no row can satisfy the filters it claimed in `handledFilters` — `IS NULL` on a NOT NULL column is the canonical case. The planner then replaces the entire table access with a static empty relation and your table is never read. Two consequences:

- **Never set it because the table is empty right now.** Planning precedes execution, and a statement can write rows into a table before reading them back (a view update materializing its missing non-preserved-side row does exactly that). "Empty at plan time" is a row count, not a proof.
- **Declining is always safe.** Leaving it absent costs one optimization and can never produce a wrong answer.

Build the answer with `AccessPlanBuilder.empty(handledFilters)`, which sets cost 0, `rows: 0`, your filter claims and the flag together. `validateAccessPlan` rejects the two half-expressed shapes as module bugs: `provablyEmpty` with no filter claimed handled (you cannot prove a predicate unsatisfiable without claiming the predicate), and `provablyEmpty` with `rows` other than 0.

> **Contract change.** `rows: 0` on a plan claiming every filter used to mean "unsatisfiable" and folded the table access away. It no longer does: such a plan is now READ and its filters enforced normally. A third-party module that relied on the old overload must set `provablyEmpty` (or call `AccessPlanBuilder.empty`) to keep the fold; one that reported an honest 0 gets the correct answer where it previously got none.

**Sizing `rows` per predicate: read `tableInfo.statistics`.**

`getBestAccessPlan` is handed the `TableSchema` itself, so everything `ANALYZE` collected
is already in scope. `tableInfo.statistics` is a `TableStatistics` — `rowCount`,
`lastAnalyzed`, and a `columnStats` map **keyed by lowercase column name** — where each
`ColumnStatistics` carries `distinctCount`, `nullCount`, `minValue`/`maxValue` and an
optional equi-height `histogram`. It is `undefined` until statistics exist for the table —
either because someone ran `ANALYZE` this session, or because a module that persists them
([Persisting statistics across a reopen](#persisting-statistics-across-a-reopen)) stamped a
saved snapshot back onto the schema at open. A column ADDED since those statistics were
collected simply has no entry; a RENAMED one keeps its entry, re-keyed onto the new name by
the engine (see [Optimizer costing § Statistics across DDL](optimizer-costing.md)). Nothing
else on the request carries these numbers; there is no separate hook to implement.

Two rules make a module's estimate usable rather than merely present:

- **Produce the number the engine would produce for the same predicate.** A seek's
  advertised `rows` and the estimate a residual `Filter` above it carries describe the same
  row set; if they disagree the optimizer is comparing two different worlds. The engine's
  `CatalogStatsProvider` prices `c = v` as `1 / max(distinctCount, 1)` and a bound as the
  histogram's verdict, then combines conjuncts with damped independence — so use the two
  exported helpers, `selectivityFromHistogram(histogram, op, value, rowCount)` and
  `combineConjunctive(factors)`, rather than restating either formula.
- **Fall back wholesale, not partially.** If any column your plan pins has no statistics,
  size the whole access from your shape constant instead of mixing a measured factor with a
  guess. Look statistics up as index → the column's *current* name → `columnStats`: an
  added column then misses cleanly, and a dropped column cannot borrow a neighbour's
  numbers. Treat `rowCount === 0` as no statistics at all: a snapshot taken while the table
  was empty (an `ANALYZE` that ran before the data load) has a `distinctCount` of 0 for
  every column, which `1 / max(distinctCount, 1)` reads as "matches every row" — the
  opposite of the truth, and enough to disable your index arms until someone re-analyzes.
  `CatalogStatsProvider` short-circuits the same case rather than applying it.

- **`rows` counts rows MATCHED, not seek keys issued.** The two coincide on a unique index
  and diverge everywhere else: `k = 5` is one seek key against a column with four distinct
  values over 2000 rows, and returns 500. `AccessPlanBuilder.eqMatch(n)` derives both cost
  and `rows` from one argument, which is convenient only when they agree — cost scales with
  the seek keys, `rows` with what they match — so pass the key count to `eqMatch` and set
  the row count separately with `.setRows(...)`. Clamp to the table size: a seek cannot
  return more rows than the table holds. The engine relays this number straight onto the
  physical seek node, where it is the input to join-algorithm selection, cache admission
  and sort costing above the seek; under-estimating it is the more dangerous direction.

`@quereus/quereus` exports `TableStatistics`, `ColumnStatistics`, `EquiHeightHistogram`,
`HistogramBucket`, `selectivityFromHistogram` and `combineConjunctive` for exactly this.
The store module (`packages/quereus-store/src/common/store-module-access-plan.ts`) is the
worked example; the memory module's equality arm (`vtab/memory/module.ts`,
`estimateEqualityRows`) is the small one.

**Claiming `handledFilters` — the positional contract**:

A module may set `handledFilters[i] = true` only for a filter it will actually apply.
For the seek-family operators (`=`, `IN`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `OR_RANGE`) the planner
consumes at most one filter per column per role — the first `=`, the first lower bound,
the first upper bound, **in `request.filters` order**. Claim positionally: mark the first
match, leave redundant same-column same-role filters unhandled so they survive as a
residual `Filter`. The planner defends itself against an over-claim by reattaching any
seek-family filter it did not consume, so an over-claiming module costs a redundant
filter, not a wrong answer.

Three corollaries worth spelling out:

- **Count distinct columns, not filters.** `a = 1 and a = 2` on a composite primary key
  `(a, b)` is *not* a full key match. Deduplicate by `columnIndex` before deciding that
  every key column is pinned.
- **Only claim what you can seek.** A range on a non-leading key column, for instance,
  is not turned into a bound; leave it unhandled.
- **A range bound is seeked only on the leading seek column.** A range on a later seek
  column is usable only as the trailing bound of a prefix seek, and only when every
  preceding seek column is pinned by a *single-valued* equality (`a = 1`, or `a in (1)`
  — not `a in (1, 2)`). Otherwise the planner declines the seek entirely and scans.
- **The residual only exists on the planned path.** Declining a filter here is safe
  because the engine reattaches it above the module. A caller that drives
  `VirtualTable.query()` *directly*, outside the planner — the isolation layer's
  primary-key probes are the in-repo example — has no engine above it to reattach
  anything, so the constraints in its hand-built `FilterInfo` are a **request**, not a
  contract. Such a caller owns re-checking every row you return, and must stay correct
  when you answer a seek with the whole table. Do not treat a direct `query()` call as
  permission to skip the negotiation: your module remains free to decline.

**Runtime-valued `IN` sets**:

`where col in (select …)` has no plan-time values. It arrives with `op: 'IN'`, **no
`value`**, and `runtimeSet: { maxCount, estimatedCount? }` instead — *"an `IN` over
`columnIndex` with 1..`maxCount` values I cannot name"*. The two fields are mutually
exclusive; `estimatedCount` is an advisory integer in `0..maxCount`.

Accepting it (`handledFilters[i] = true`, plus `indexName` and `seekColumnIndexes`)
promises one thing: you can serve that column as a multi-seek on the named index. In
return, `query()` gets an ordinary `plan=5` multi-seek `FilterInfo` — `K` EQ constraints
and `K` values in `args`, `1 ≤ K ≤ maxCount` — indistinguishable from a literal list, so
**your runtime does not change**. The engine, not the module, enforces `maxCount`: an empty
or oversized set falls back to a scan and never reaches you. Only single-column runtime
sets exist today.

Declining is always correct; only the speed-up is lost. A module predating `runtimeSet`
declines automatically, since `Array.isArray(f.value) && f.value.length > 0` is false.

**But never answer a `runtimeSet` request with your own scan verdict.** A request carrying
`runtimeSet` on any filter is engine-synthesized: `rule-key-set-seek` probes the module
twice, at 2 keys and at `maxCount`, and reads *either* answer that names no index as "the
module declined", abandoning the whole rewrite. So a module that otherwise compares its
seek against a sequential scan and returns the scan when the seek looks worse must skip that
comparison here, and answer with the seek plan and its honest cost. The engine makes the
scan comparison itself — it interpolates a break-even key count from the two costs you
return, so what it needs from you is a *cost that varies with `maxCount`*, not a verdict.
Keep that cost as close to linear in the key count as you can: two points are all the engine
gets, so a sharply non-linear cost makes its interpolation meaningless.

If you accept one: claim `providesOrdering` or `monotonicOn` over its column only if your
multi-seek emits in the index's own KEY order — which the hard requirement below obliges
it to anyway. A multi-seek that walks in seek-argument order must claim neither, or the
planner elides a `Sort` it needs. The store's `_primary_` arm is the worked example: it
sorts its points by encoded key and so does advertise primary-key order, which is what
lets `where pk in (select …) order by pk` drop its Sort. Also
apply your existing safety gates — collation windows that may under-fetch, semantically
compared seek columns, your own cross-product cap — against `maxCount`, the worst case you
could be handed. Use the exported `equalitySeekKeyCount(filter)` (seek keys it contributes
as an equality, or `null` when it fills no equality role) and `isMultiValueEquality(filter)`
rather than re-deriving the four `IN` shapes.

**Naming the chosen index — `indexName` and `indexDescriptor`**:

When a module sets `indexName` (and `seekColumnIndexes`) the engine records the choice on
the physical leaf as both a text `idxStr` and a structured `FilterInfo.accessPath`. Order-
sensitive consumers — most importantly the transaction-isolation overlay, which must merge
its per-connection changes in the *same sort order the underlying scan emits* — read the
structured form to learn what the index actually is: whether it is the primary key, its full
key columns, and whether it is unique.

The engine resolves that structure itself in two cases:

- `indexName` is `_primary_` (the primary key), or
- `indexName` matches an index present in `tableInfo.indexes` (case-insensitive).

If your module names the index anything else — most commonly a **per-plan alias** for the
primary key, e.g. `_primary_1`, minted so a downstream layer can recover which plan produced
a given scan — the engine cannot resolve it from the schema. You **must** then also return an
`indexDescriptor`:

```typescript
interface IndexDescriptor {
  name: string;                 // must equal the plan's indexName
  role: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  keyColumns: readonly { columnIndex: number; desc: boolean; collation?: string }[]; // FULL key, in index order
  unique: boolean;
  reverse?: boolean;            // true ⇒ the scan walks this index in reverse of keyColumns order
}
```

`role` is authoritative, not `name`: a descriptor with `role: 'primary'` **is** the primary
key however it is named. `validateAccessPlan` rejects a descriptor whose `name` disagrees with
the plan's index name.

Scan **direction** matters to the same order-sensitive consumers: a module whose `idxStr` already
encodes direction (the in-memory vtab's `ordCons=DESC` convention) needs nothing extra, but a
module that carries direction only in an opaque per-plan index name — minting a distinct name per
scan direction rather than writing a direction marker anywhere text-visible — **must** set
`reverse: true` on the descriptor for a reversed scan. Otherwise an emission-order consumer (the
isolation overlay's merged read) has no way to learn the underlying stream is reversed and merges
it against a forward comparator, scrambling row order.

**Multi-seek key order is a hard requirement, independent of `providesOrdering`.** A
`multiSeek` access path (`plan=5`) must emit its rows in the scanned index's own key
order, never in seek-argument order (the order the `IN` list appears in the SQL text, or
a runtime set's iteration order) — even though the guidance above says not to *claim*
`providesOrdering` over such a plan. The transaction-isolation overlay's merge assumes an
index access path emits in index-key order for any plan kind whose resolved index has
`role: 'primary'` or names a known secondary index (see Scan direction, above, for the
`reverse` half of the same contract); it mis-pairs overlay rows against stale stored rows
when that assumption is violated (fix/bug-isolation-multiseek-merge-order). Both shipped
backends (the in-memory table and the persistent store) sort their multi-seek keys under
the index's own key comparator before visiting them for exactly this reason. A module
whose multi-seek does not sort equivalently corrupts reads for any table wrapped in
`create table ... using isolated`.

A module that aliases an index name **without** supplying a matching `indexDescriptor` has its
access path recorded as `{ kind: 'unresolvedIndex' }` (and the engine logs a warning). Order-
sensitive consumers refuse an unresolved plan rather than guess — so the alias-without-
descriptor path is a correctness bug in the module, not a slow path. Name the primary key
`_primary_` or supply the descriptor.

**When to use**: Most modules (in-memory tables, file-based storage, traditional indexes).

**Example**: [Indexed Table](#indexed-table), under Common Patterns.

### 3. Concurrency Mode (Parallel Runtime)

> **Stability: Experimental** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

When a parallel-runtime consumer (e.g. fan-out lookup join) wants to issue
multiple vtab calls in flight on a single connection, it consults the
module's declared `concurrencyMode`. By default, modules opt out of
parallelism — the runtime acquires a per-connection lock so calls are
serialized.

```typescript
interface VirtualTableModule {
  readonly concurrencyMode?: 'serial' | 'reentrant-reads' | 'fully-reentrant';
}
```

| Mode | Per-connection guarantee from the module |
| --- | --- |
| `'serial'` (default) | Nothing. Runtime serializes via `acquireConnectionLock`. |
| `'reentrant-reads'` | Concurrent `query()` is safe; writes still serialize. |
| `'fully-reentrant'` | All operations are safe to interleave on one connection. |

**Default is `'serial'`** — the safe choice for any module that hasn't
been audited. The cost is that parallel consumers fall back to lock
serialization on shared connections, defeating parallelism for that
module. The declaration is the knob that actually buys parallelism;
nothing else needs to change.

**Upgrading a module:**

1. Identify the connection-level state mutated by `query()`, `update()`,
   savepoints, etc. If `query()` snapshots its working set at call entry
   and never touches state another call writes, `'reentrant-reads'` is
   safe.
2. Walk through the worst-case interleavings under
   single-threaded JS: torn reads can only happen if a write publishes
   state in more than one statement step. Atomic single-statement
   pointer swaps are safe; multi-step state machines aren't.
3. For `'fully-reentrant'`, the same holds for writes. This is a much
   higher bar and is usually not worth it — `'reentrant-reads'` is the
   common upgrade target.

The runtime helpers live at `vtab/concurrency.ts`:

```typescript
import { getModuleConcurrencyMode, acquireConnectionLock } from '@quereus/quereus';

const mode = getModuleConcurrencyMode(module);
if (mode === 'serial') {
  const release = await acquireConnectionLock(connection);
  try {
    for await (const row of vtab.query(filterInfo)) yield row;
  } finally {
    release();
  }
}
```

Memory vtab declares `'reentrant-reads'`: `query()` captures the
connection's read or pending layer at call entry and iterates that
captured BTree, so concurrent reads on one connection see consistent,
non-mutating snapshots. Writes serialize because, once a transaction is
open, subsequent writes mutate the existing pending layer's BTree in
place — `'fully-reentrant'` would require either fresh-per-write layers
or an iterator-safe mutation path. Layered stores, isolation wrappers,
and persistent plugins stay default until their owners audit them.

### 4. Committed-Snapshot Reads (`_readCommitted`)

The `readCommittedSnapshot` declaration — the obligation a module takes on by promising a
consistent committed state to a read that overlaps another connection's commit, the two
implementation shapes that meet it, what a wrapper module must do to avoid degrading a
snapshot-safe underlying, and the `runCommittedReadConformance` harness that proves it —
lives in [module-committed-reads.md](module-committed-reads.md).

### 5. Backing Host (Materialized-View Backing Tables)

A module may volunteer to host materialized-view backing tables by implementing
the optional `getBackingHost` hook — presence of the method is the capability
(the `getMappingAdvertisements` signaling style):

```typescript
interface VirtualTableModule {
  getBackingHost?(db: Database, schemaName: string, tableName: string): BackingHost | undefined;
}
```

`BackingHost` (`vtab/backing-host.ts`; `BackingHost`, `BackingScanRequest`,
`MaintenanceOp`, and `BackingRowChange` are exported from the package root) is
the privileged per-table surface the engine drives MV maintenance through:

- `ownsConnection(conn)` — true when `conn` is a live connection to **this**
  backing-table incarnation. The host must be pinned to one incarnation (capture
  the table's internal handle by reference at resolve time): after a
  drop+recreate of the same name, the new host must reject the old
  incarnation's connections.
- `connect()` — a fresh `VirtualTableConnection`; the engine registers it so
  coordinated commit/rollback (savepoint replay included) covers its pending
  state in lockstep with the source write.
- `applyMaintenance(conn, ops)` — apply an ordered `MaintenanceOp` batch
  (`delete-key` / `upsert` / `delete-by-prefix` / `replace-all`) to `conn`'s
  **pending** transaction state, bypassing user-DML read-only enforcement while
  keeping secondary-index / change-tracking bookkeeping. Returns the
  **effective** `BackingRowChange`s realized — exact reporting is part of the
  contract (the MV-over-MV cascade replays them; no-op ops yield nothing,
  `replace-all` yields the minimal keyed diff). Later reads on `conn` must
  observe the applied ops (reads-own-writes).
- `replaceContents(rows, onDuplicateKey?)` — atomically replace the
  **committed** contents (create-fill / refresh); throw `onDuplicateKey()` (or a
  generic `CONSTRAINT`) on a duplicate PK; concurrent readers see pre- or
  post-swap state, never partial.
- `scanEffective(conn, { equalityPrefix?, descending? })` — reads-own-writes
  scan over `conn`'s effective state in PK order, honoring `equalityPrefix` as a
  seek + early-terminate leading-PK prefix range.

**Cost contract:** PK-ordered storage with O(log n) keyed
upsert/delete/point-lookup **and** the ordered prefix-range scan are required —
do not advertise the capability without them (the engine does not gate per
maintenance arm). A backing table must reject user DML (READONLY) while
admitting the privileged surface, and the engine adds no latching around it —
the host owns its own concurrency discipline under the module's declared
`concurrencyMode`. The memory module is the reference implementation
(`MemoryTableModule.getBackingHost`); the store module is the second realized
host (`StoreBackingHost` in `@quereus/store` — pending state on the per-table
`TransactionCoordinator`, reads-own-writes via the store's pending-merge read
paths, with the isolation wrapper forwarding the capability conditionally); see
[`docs/mv-backing-host.md`](mv-backing-host.md#backing-host-capability)
for the engine-side view.

A capability-advertising module is selectable as an MV's backing host via
`create materialized view mv using <module>(args) as <body>` (omitting the
clause defaults to memory) — the create builder and the catalog-import path
both gate on `getBackingHost` presence and reject a capability-less module with
a sited `UNSUPPORTED`. One soft edge rides on `alterTable` rather than the
capability itself: source column-rename propagation renames the backing's
shifted columns through the host module's `alterTable`; a host without it
throws `UNSUPPORTED` and the propagation's failure path marks the MV stale
(recoverable by `refresh`) instead of renaming in place.

**Durable hosts and the rehydrate adopt fast path.** By default, catalog import
drops a pre-existing same-module `_mv_<name>` table and refills it from the body
— always correct, never trusting persisted derived rows. A durable host that
wants the adopt-without-refill fast path on reopen does two things: persist its
backing as an **ordinary table entry** in its catalog (so its own rehydration
phase 1 reconnects the table before the MV entries import), and pass
`importCatalog`'s `trustBackings: true` (plus one shared `adoptedBackings` set
across the session's calls) **only when it can attest no crash since the last
open** — the store module's vehicle is a single-use clean-shutdown catalog
marker written by `closeAll` and consumed at `rehydrateCatalog`. Never pass
`trustBackings` unconditionally: the engine's remaining gates are DDL-level and
cannot see content divergence from a crash. See
[`docs/mv-backing-host.md` § Cross-module atomicity](mv-backing-host.md#cross-module-atomicity)
for the full gate set.

## `normalizeCreateSchema` — "what would this schema become?"

Some modules rewrite a table schema on the way through `create`. The store module
supplies its table-level key collation `K` to a text primary-key column that declares
no `COLLATE` clause, so `create table t (a text primary key) using store` registers `a`
as `COLLATE NOCASE`, not the engine's BINARY default.

That rewrite is invisible to the engine, which mattered in one place: a materialized
view's backing. The engine re-derives the backing's shape from the body on reopen and on
refresh and compares it to the live table. Derivation produces the *pre*-rewrite shape
while the live table carries the *post*-rewrite one, so the comparison reported a
difference that did not exist — a text-keyed backing failed the adopt gate and re-ran its
whole body on **every** reopen.

The optional hook lets the engine ask the module the question directly, without creating
anything:

```typescript
interface VirtualTableModule {
  /** Deterministic, side-effect free. May adjust per-column attributes the module owns
   *  physically; may NOT add, remove, reorder, or rename columns. */
  normalizeCreateSchema?(tableSchema: TableSchema): TableSchema;
}
```

Rules for an implementor:

- **Route your own `create` through it.** The rewrite must have exactly one owner, or the
  engine's answer and your actual create can drift. `StoreModule.create` calls
  `this.normalizeCreateSchema(tableSchema)` instead of the rewrite directly.
- **Read your configuration off the schema.** The hook takes no extra parameters; the
  store reads `K` from `tableSchema.vtabArgs`, so the answer is a pure function of the
  input.
- **Stay pure and shape-preserving.** The engine calls it on a *probe* schema (columns,
  column-index map, physical primary key, `vtabArgs` — no module state, no table
  behind it) outside any create, and may call it more than once. Changing the column
  count, or a column's name or position, is a contract violation and raises `INTERNAL`
  rather than being read as a shape difference.
- **Omit it** if your module creates schemas verbatim — the engine then treats
  normalization as the identity (memory, and every module written before the hook
  existed).
- **A wrapper module must forward it** by presence, exactly like `getBackingHost` and
  `createBacking` — `IsolationModule` assigns it in its constructor only when the
  underlying module implements it. A wrapper that delegates `create` but hides the hook
  reintroduces the asymmetry the hook exists to close.

Engine side: `deriveBackingShape` applies it (`normalizeBackingShape` in
`runtime/emit/materialized-view-helpers.ts`) before any comparison against a live table,
so `backingShapeMatches`, `describeBackingShapeMismatch`, the refresh reshape classifier
and the rename-propagation assertion all see post-normalization shapes. One subtlety: an
attribute the body left *implicit* is ambiguous once a table exists, because explicitness
is not persisted (`ColumnSchema.collationExplicit` — a declared `COLLATE BINARY` reloads
indistinguishable from no clause). Such a column is therefore compatible with either its
own declared value or the module's normalized one, and the reading that agrees with the
live table wins — so a `create table … maintained` whose text key is declared
`COLLATE BINARY` keeps matching its own declaration. A value matching neither reading is
still a real mismatch.

## Capability negotiation surface

The inventory of every negotiation surface on the `VirtualTableModule` contract — how each
one is signaled, what the engine substitutes when a module omits it, which built-in modules
implement it, the DDL transactionality tiers, the per-arm `alterTable` mandate table, and the
negotiation pattern new modules should follow — lives in
[module-capabilities.md](module-capabilities.md).

## Runtime Execution Modes

### Query-Based Execution

If module implements `supports()`, implement `executePlan()`:

```typescript
interface VirtualTable {
  executePlan?(
    db: Database,
    plan: PlanNode,
    ctx?: unknown
  ): AsyncIterable<Row>;
}
```

The module receives the entire pipeline and executes it within its own context.

### Index-Based Execution

If module implements `getBestAccessPlan()`, implement `query()`:

```typescript
interface VirtualTable {
  query?(filterInfo: FilterInfo): AsyncIterable<Row>;
}

interface FilterInfo {
  args: SqlValue[];           // Constraint values
  argIndices: number[];       // Which constraints are provided
  limit?: number;             // Optional row cap (LIMIT pushdown)
  offset?: number;            // Optional kth-row seek (only valid when supportsOrdinalSeek was advertised)
}
```

The module receives individual constraints and returns matching rows.

**Pushdown directives**: `FilterInfo.limit` is a *runtime* row cap and — unlike the plan-time `BestAccessPlanRequest.limit` above — genuinely soft: a streaming guard above the leaf enforces the count either way, so ignoring it costs work, never answers. Modules may stop emitting once `limit` rows have been yielded. `FilterInfo.offset` is a seek-to-kth-row directive and is only set when the access plan advertised `supportsOrdinalSeek` for this query — modules without ordinal-seek support can ignore both fields safely (a streaming guard above the leaf still enforces correctness).

## Optimization Integration Points

### Physical Property Computation

Modules should communicate:
- **Cardinality**: Estimated row count
- **Ordering**: If module provides sorted output
- **Uniqueness**: If result is guaranteed unique

These properties enable the optimizer to make better decisions about join order, aggregation strategy, and materialization.

### Binding Capture

When predicates are pushed into the `Retrieve` pipeline, parameters and correlated column references are captured:

```typescript
// Query with parameter
select * from users where id = ?;

// Retrieve.bindings contains: [ParameterReference(1)]
// At runtime, the module receives the parameter value via FilterInfo.args
```

This enables efficient parameterized queries and correlated subqueries.

## Transaction Support

Modules can implement transaction methods for ACID compliance:

```typescript
interface VirtualTable {
  begin?(): Promise<void>;
  commit?(): Promise<void>;
  rollback?(): Promise<void>;
  savepoint?(index: number): Promise<void>;
  rollbackTo?(index: number): Promise<void>;
  release?(index: number): Promise<void>;
}
```

See [runtime.md](runtime.md) for transaction semantics.

### DDL inside an open transaction

`createIndex` and the row-validating `alterTable` arms (`ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE`,
`ALTER COLUMN ... SET COLLATE`, and the two value-rewriting arms `ALTER COLUMN ... SET DATA TYPE`
/ `ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`, whose rewrite can collapse two distinct values onto one) can be
invoked while the calling connection has uncommitted writes. Two obligations follow, and both bundled modules meet them:

*   **Validate against the effective rows**, not the committed ones — the rows a `SELECT` on
    that connection would return. Scanning committed rows alone lets a duplicate the
    transaction just inserted slip past the check and land under a constraint that forbids it.
*   **Enforce the new constraint for the rest of that transaction.** A module that snapshots
    the table schema per transaction must refresh that snapshot, or the statement after the
    DDL is checked against a schema that does not yet know the constraint exists.

A third obligation is independent of open transactions: **a refused DDL call must leave
nothing behind, because the engine unwinds nothing.** `SchemaManager` registers (or
deregisters) the object in its own catalog only *after* `createIndex` / `dropIndex` /
`alterTable` returns, and re-wraps a throw without any cleanup. Everything the module already
did therefore outlives the refused statement — a physical structure it built, a catalog entry
it wrote, and above all a cached `VirtualTable.tableSchema` it swapped, which leaves the
module one schema ahead of the engine: it keeps maintaining a structure the engine never
registered, or stops maintaining one the engine still plans seeks against. Validate before
creating any physical artifact where the check allows it; where a later step can still throw,
undo the earlier ones. `StoreModuleIndex.unwindFailedIndexDdl` is the store module's shared
undo for both index arms — it records how far the statement got and runs the exact inverse,
newest step first. A cleanup step that throws must be logged and swallowed, never allowed to
replace the error the caller has to see.

Neither module makes DDL itself transactional: the catalog entry and any physical structure
are written outside the transaction coordinator, so a `ROLLBACK` discards the rows but leaves
the index behind. That is safe only because both re-validate an index entry against the live
row before returning or acting on it. See [memory-table.md](memory-table.md) § DDL and
transactions for the full statement of the boundary and what a fully-cooperating module would
do instead.

#### When the pending rows live outside your module: `EffectiveRowSource`

A module cannot always reach the transaction's uncommitted rows. Under the isolation layer
(`@quereus/isolation`) each connection's writes are staged in a private in-memory *overlay*;
the wrapped module holds only committed rows and cannot see the overlay at all. Its own
"effective rows" are therefore the committed rows, and the first obligation above becomes
impossible to meet unaided.

The optional last parameter of `createIndex` and `alterTable` closes that gap:

```ts
/** Re-callable; each call returns a fresh stream. */
export type EffectiveRowSource = () => AsyncIterable<Row>;

createIndex?(db, schemaName, tableName, indexSchema, rows?: EffectiveRowSource): Promise<void>;
alterTable?(db, schemaName, tableName, change, rows?: EffectiveRowSource): Promise<TableSchema>;
createIndex?(indexSchema, rows?: EffectiveRowSource): Promise<void>;   // VirtualTable, instance level
```

**Who supplies it.** Only a wrapper module that holds the issuing connection's pending rows
outside the target module. The engine's own emitters (`CREATE INDEX`, `ALTER TABLE`) pass
nothing, so an unwrapped module keeps validating its own effective rows exactly as before. The
isolation layer supplies its issuing connection's merged view: committed rows, minus the ones
that connection's overlay tombstones, superseded by the ones it rewrote, plus the ones it
added. A *foreign* connection's overlay never contributes — its staged duplicates are its own
problem at commit time, exactly as a concurrent duplicate insert would be.

**What the receiver must do with it.** When `rows` is present it is the ONLY set the module may
judge row CONTENT against:

*   Every row-content check — UNIQUE duplicate detection, collation-rekey collision detection,
    value-rewrite collapse detection (`SET DATA TYPE` / `SET NOT NULL` backfill, judged with the
    altered column already converted) — reads this stream.
*   The module MUST NOT reject the DDL as a *constraint violation* over a duplicate that exists
    only in its own committed data. That duplicate may be a row the issuing transaction has
    already deleted; calling it invalid data is a false positive the caller cannot work around.
    **One narrow exception:** a structure that physically cannot *hold* the duplicate — a re-keyed
    PRIMARY KEY tree, which is a map, not a multi-map, and whose committed rows must survive a
    rollback — may still refuse. It must do so as `BUSY` ("commit/rollback and retry"), never
    `CONSTRAINT`: the data is valid, the storage merely cannot represent it while those rows are
    still resident. Both bundled backends do exactly this for `ALTER COLUMN … SET COLLATE` on a
    PK member.
*   Physical structures are still built from the module's OWN rows. Building an index over
    committed rows while validating over the merged view is deliberate and sound: an index entry
    with no live row behind it is harmless, because every reader resolves an entry back to its
    live row and drops it when the row is gone. Both bundled modules document this at the build
    site (`BaseLayer.addIndexToBase`, `StoreModule.buildIndexEntries`).
*   Validate BEFORE creating any physical artifact, so a rejection leaves nothing behind.

`rows` is re-callable because a single `ALTER` may validate more than once (one pass per UNIQUE
constraint covering the altered column). Row order is unspecified — every consumer is a
set-shaped check.

Not covered: a PRIMARY KEY collision introduced by `ALTER COLUMN ... SET COLLATE` on a PK
member. The wrapper's staged rows are re-keyed inside the wrapper's own overlay and the
module's inside its own store, so a pending row that collides with a committed one under the
new collation is checked by neither. Both re-key sites carry a `NOTE:` to that effect.

### Connection Registration

For modules that need to participate in the database's transaction coordination (e.g., receiving `commit()` and `rollback()` calls when the database commits or rolls back), you must register connections with the database.

The `DatabaseInternal` interface exposes internal methods for this purpose:

```typescript
import type { Database, DatabaseInternal, VirtualTableConnection } from '@quereus/quereus';

class MyTable extends VirtualTable {
  private connection: MyConnection | null = null;

  private async ensureConnection(): Promise<MyConnection> {
    if (!this.connection) {
      this.connection = new MyConnection(this.tableName);
      
      // Register with database for transaction coordination
      await (this.db as DatabaseInternal).registerConnection(this.connection);
    }
    return this.connection;
  }
}
```

**`DatabaseInternal` methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `registerConnection(conn)` | Registers a connection for transaction management. If a transaction is already active, `begin()` is called on the connection and the active savepoint stack is replayed by calling `createSavepoint(depth)` for each open depth, so subsequent `releaseSavepoint` / `rollbackToSavepoint` broadcasts targeting earlier depths are in-range on the new connection. |
| `unregisterConnection(id)` | Unregisters a connection. May be deferred during implicit transactions. |
| `getConnection(id)` | Gets a connection by ID. |
| `getConnectionsForTable(name)` | Gets all connections for a table. Matches the qualified name *or* the bare table name, so it can reach a same-named table in another schema. Useful for connection reuse. |
| `getAllConnections()` | Gets all active connections. |
| `removeConnectionsForTable(schema, table)` | Force-removes **every** connection registered under `schema.table`, bypassing the implicit-transaction deferral. Only correct when the table itself is going away (`destroy` / drop), where no connection under that name can still have state worth committing. The engine calls it for you on drop. |
| `removeConnection(id)` | Force-removes one connection by id, bypassing the deferral. This is the tool a `renameTable` implementation needs. |

**Evicting connections on `renameTable`:**

The engine's rename path does *not* evict connections, so a module whose connections are pinned to the old table name must evict them itself or leak one per rename. Evict **only the connections your own module created** — discriminate with `instanceof` (or a brand property) *and* an exact qualified-name match, then call `removeConnection(conn.connectionId)` on each:

```typescript
const oldQualified = `${schemaName}.${oldName}`.toLowerCase();
for (const conn of dbInternal.getAllConnections()) {
  if (conn instanceof MyConnection && conn.tableName.toLowerCase() === oldQualified) {
    dbInternal.removeConnection(conn.connectionId);
  }
}
```

Do **not** reach for `removeConnectionsForTable` here. A wrapping module — `IsolationModule` is the one in-tree — registers its own connection under the same qualified name, and that connection is the only thing that drives its staged writes to storage at `COMMIT`. A blanket name-keyed sweep deletes it, and the transaction's writes vanish while the commit reports success.

**Connection reuse pattern:**

Before creating a new connection, check if one already exists for the table:

```typescript
private async ensureConnection(): Promise<MyConnection> {
  if (!this.connection) {
    // Check for existing connection to reuse
    const dbInternal = this.db as DatabaseInternal;
    const existing = dbInternal.getConnectionsForTable(this.tableName);
    
    if (existing.length > 0 && existing[0] instanceof MyConnection) {
      this.connection = existing[0];
    } else {
      // Create and register new connection
      this.connection = new MyConnection(this.tableName);
      await dbInternal.registerConnection(this.connection);
    }
  }
  return this.connection;
}
```

**Adopting a runtime-offered connection (`adoptConnection`):**

The reuse pattern above is *pull*: your `ensureConnection` looks the registry up when it happens to run. The runtime also *pushes* — when it materializes a fresh `VirtualTable` instance for a table that already has a registered connection, it offers that connection to the instance via the optional `adoptConnection` hook on `VirtualTable`, so the new instance reuses the in-flight connection (and its uncommitted transaction state) instead of opening a rival one:

```typescript
adoptConnection(connection: VirtualTableConnection): void {
  // Reject connections another module registered under the same qualified name.
  if (!(connection instanceof MyConnection)) return;
  // Reject a stale connection whose backing state no longer matches this instance
  // (e.g. a dropped-then-recreated table); adopt only when the state matches.
  if (connection.backingStore !== this.store) return;
  this.connection = connection;
}
```

Contract:

- **The module owns the accept/reject decision.** The runtime knows nothing about your connection type — it hands you the registered `VirtualTableConnection` and ignores the return value. Downcast with `instanceof` (or a brand check) and reject connections you did not create, plus connections whose backing state no longer matches this instance. Silently do nothing when you decline.
- **Ownership is not transferred.** The adopted connection stays owned by the database connection registry that registered it. Adopting it must not make this instance responsible for closing it beyond your module's existing `disconnect` contract.
- **It must be idempotent.** Calling `adoptConnection` more than once on the same instance must be safe (re-setting the same connection).

Implement the hook when a table's uncommitted state lives on the connection and a second instance of the same table within one statement must see it. Modules whose per-instance state is self-contained can omit it — a module without the hook behaves exactly as before (the runtime's optional-chain call is a no-op).

**When to use connection registration:**

- Your module maintains state that must be committed or rolled back with transactions
- You need to flush changes to persistent storage on commit
- You implement an isolation layer with overlay tables
- You coordinate with external systems that have their own transaction semantics

**Note:** The `DatabaseInternal` interface is marked `@internal` and may change between versions. It's intended for tight integration scenarios like storage backends and isolation layers.

## Identifier casing in module-facing calls

Every SchemaManager → module hook receives **canonical stored names**, never the raw spelling of the triggering statement:

- `schemaName` is **canonical** — lowercase, folded through `SchemaManager.canonicalSchemaName`. A `MAIN.t` qualifier, or an unqualified statement under a non-`main` current schema, reaches the module as `main` / `aux` / … exactly as `getCurrentSchemaName()` would resolve it.
- An existing object's **own name** (table name to `connect` / `createIndex` / `dropIndex` / `destroy`, the index name to `dropIndex`) is its **stored display casing** — the casing captured when the object was created — not the casing used in the `create index … on T` / `drop index iDx` / `drop table T` that triggered the call.

This holds for the whole hook surface: `create`, `connect`, `createIndex`, `dropIndex`, `destroy`, `alterTable`, `renameTable`, `getBackingHost`, and the auto-emitted schema-change events. Because the names are stored and stable, a module **may** key its storage, physical stores, and internal registries by the call arguments verbatim — a table created under one casing and later dropped/queried under another will address the same key. (`create` is handed the full canonical `TableSchema`, so its `tableSchema.schemaName` / `tableSchema.name` follow the same rule.)

**The one as-spelled exception** is a *new* object's own name — the index name in `createIndex` (`indexSchema.name`) and `newName` in `renameTable`. These are not yet stored; they *become* the stored name, carrying the casing as written in the DDL (the same way `CREATE TABLE Foo` stores `Foo`). A module that persists the new object should adopt that casing as its stored display name.

This is the module-call analogue of the schema-change event naming contract; see [schema § Schema Change Events](schema.md#event-types).

## Best Practices

### 1. Estimate honestly

`cost` and `rows` drive join order, aggregation strategy, and materialization decisions, so
a wrong estimate buys a wrong plan. Charge `O(n)` for a sequential scan, `O(log n)` for an
index seek, `O(k + log n)` for an index scan returning `k` rows. Push filtering in wherever
you can: what you decline stays a residual above the boundary, so a pushed filter costs
nothing and saves transfer.

Charge the work your seek actually does. `AccessPlanBuilder.eqMatch` / `.rangeScan` price
walking a matched window and nothing more, so a module whose secondary index stores row
IDENTIFIERS rather than rows — it must read each matched row out of a second place — pays a
per-row term those shapes do not model. Add it with `addCost(rows * yourPerRowCost)` rather
than recomputing the factory's formula, so your arm cannot drift from the shape it started
from. The store module does exactly this (the `pointRead` term in
`store-module-access-plan.ts`).

What that per-row term costs may depend on the BACKEND rather than on the module: a random
row read is nearly free in-process and block-cached, and is a separate request across an IPC
boundary in a browser. If your module runs over more than one backend, let each backend
declare the ratio and price your arms from the declaration rather than from one constant —
the store module's `KVCostProfile` (`@quereus/store`, `src/common/cost-profile.ts`) is the
worked example, including its unit (one sequentially scanned row = 1.0) and its rule that an
undeclared backend must plan exactly as it did before the knob existed.

**Nothing compares your plan with an alternative.** `rule-select-access-path` takes the
single plan you return and uses it, so an index seek priced ABOVE your own sequential scan
still wins unless you reject it yourself: compare the seek's cost against the scan's and
return the scan when the seek loses. Losing that way is safe — a scan that claims no
filters leaves every predicate in the residual, so the rows are identical and only the
speed changes.

### 2. Report capabilities conservatively

If `supports()` returns a result, the module must execute that pipeline correctly; if
`getBestAccessPlan()` marks a filter handled, the module must apply it. Over-reporting
yields silent wrong answers, not slow ones.

### 3. Preserve Attribute IDs

When implementing `xExecutePlan()`, preserve the attribute IDs from the input plan:
- Column references use stable attribute IDs
- Transformations must maintain these IDs
- See [runtime.md](runtime.md) for attribute system details

## Common Patterns

### Indexed Table

A scan-only module is this one minus the seek arm: return `handledFilters` all-false with
scan cost and let every predicate stay residual.

```typescript
class IndexedTable extends VirtualTable {
  private index = new Map<SqlValue, Row[]>();

  getBestAccessPlan(req: BestAccessPlanRequest): BestAccessPlanResult {
    // Claim the FIRST '=' on column 0 only — a second `id = ...` is never seeked
    // and must stay residual. See "Claiming handledFilters" above.
    const eqIndex = req.filters.findIndex(f => f.op === '=' && f.columnIndex === 0);
    if (eqIndex >= 0) {
      return {
        handledFilters: req.filters.map((_f, i) => i === eqIndex),
        cost: 1,
        rows: 1,
        isSet: true,
        explains: 'Index equality seek'
      };
    }
    return {
      handledFilters: req.filters.map(() => false),
      cost: 100,
      rows: 100,
      explains: 'Full table scan'
    };
  }

  async* query(filterInfo: FilterInfo): AsyncIterable<Row> {
    if (filterInfo.argIndices.length > 0) {
      const key = filterInfo.args[0];
      yield* this.index.get(key) || [];
    } else {
      for (const rows of this.index.values()) {
        yield* rows;
      }
    }
  }

  async update(op: string, values?: Row, oldKeys?: Row): Promise<Row | undefined> {
    if (op === 'insert' && values) {
      const key = values[0];
      if (!this.index.has(key)) this.index.set(key, []);
      this.index.get(key)!.push(values);
    }
    return undefined;
  }

  async disconnect(): Promise<void> {}
}
```

## Statistics for Cost-Based Optimization

Virtual table modules can optionally provide statistics for the optimizer's cost model. Implement `getStatistics()` on your `VirtualTable` subclass to report what your storage already knows **exactly**: the row count, plus per-column distinct values, min/max and histograms *only* where you maintain them. Report nothing else — `ANALYZE` scans for whatever you leave out, and both shipped backends leave out everything but the row count.

```typescript
import type { TableStatistics, ColumnStatistics } from '@quereus/quereus';

class MyTable extends VirtualTable {
  getStatistics(): TableStatistics {
    return {
      rowCount: this.data.length,
      // Both figures are exact and maintained by this module's write paths — `id` is the
      // primary key, and `uniqueNames` is a running count. A module that would have to
      // sample for these reports `columnStats: new Map()` instead and lets ANALYZE scan.
      columnStats: new Map([
        ['id', { distinctCount: this.data.length, nullCount: 0 }],
        ['name', { distinctCount: this.uniqueNames, nullCount: 0 }],
      ]),
    };
  }
}
```

The `ANALYZE` command calls `getStatistics()` when it is implemented, and otherwise collects statistics by scanning the table. Statistics are cached on `TableSchema.statistics` and consumed by `CatalogStatsProvider` for selectivity estimation.

`ANALYZE` also runs **on its own**: once a table has drifted past the `auto_analyze` threshold, the engine runs it for that table from a background timer (see `docs/sql-txn.md` §9.5). Both hooks below are therefore called without any user statement in flight, and `saveStatistics` may be called for a table nobody asked about — neither may assume it is running inside a user's `ANALYZE`.

**Report a column statistic only if it is exact over every live row the connection can see. A sample is not an answer** — leave `columnStats` empty and let `ANALYZE` scan. The figures here are consumed as facts, not as estimates: a `distinctCount` derived from the first N values understates cardinality, and a `nullCount` computed as `rowCount - sampleSize` counts every un-sampled row as a NULL. The memory backend shipped exactly that for a while — a systematic sample capped at 1000 values per column, correct at or below 1000 rows and wrong above it — which is why it now reports its size and nothing else.

Exact does not have to mean expensive. A count maintained by the write paths, or read off index metadata, qualifies; what does not qualify is any figure whose accuracy depends on how big the table happens to be. If the exact figure would cost a scan, do not compute it — that is `ANALYZE`'s job, and it already does it once for every column in a single pass.

**Decline while you cannot see the whole picture.** An implementation that answers from committed state only is wrong inside an open transaction, where it describes the table as it was before the transaction started. Return `undefined` in that situation, as `IsolatedTable` does while its overlay is dirty, rather than reporting a stale number. (Reporting only a row count is a milder version of the same problem, and survives it: `ANALYZE` prefers its own scan's count, which reflects what the connection can see.)

Returning **`undefined`** declines for the state the table is currently in, and `ANALYZE` scans exactly as it would for a module that never implemented the hook. That is for a wrapper whose cheap answer would be wrong for the read it is serving — the isolation layer declines while a transaction's overlay is dirty, since its underlying reports the committed base and would miss the connection's own uncommitted rows.

A row count with an **empty** `columnStats` is a supported partial answer, for a module that can size itself cheaply but keeps no value distribution: `ANALYZE` reads it as *"size answered, collect the rest yourself"*, still scans for the per-column numbers, and prefers the scan's row count (it counted every live row; a maintained count can drift). Nothing consults `getStatistics()` during *planning* — to get a live size into cost decisions between `ANALYZE`s, fill in `request.estimatedRows` from `getBestAccessPlan` (see [Index-Based Access](#2-index-based-access-standard)).

### Persisting statistics across a reopen

Statistics collected by `ANALYZE` live on `TableSchema.statistics`, which is in-memory only — close the database and they are gone. A module with durable storage can implement the optional companion hook so the next open reads them back instead of planning blind until someone re-runs `ANALYZE`:

```typescript
class MyTable extends VirtualTable {
  async saveStatistics(stats: TableStatistics): Promise<void> {
    await this.backend.writeStats(this.tableName, stats);
  }
}
```

`ANALYZE` calls it once per table, right after it writes the statistics onto the schema. Three rules:

- **It is advisory.** A rejection is logged and swallowed — `ANALYZE` succeeding with statistics in memory but not on disk is strictly better than `ANALYZE` failing. Do not throw to signal "I could not store these"; just return.
- **Persisting less than you were given is fine.** `ColumnStatistics.histogram` can run to a few KB per column, so a module may drop what it cannot use and keep the scalar fields. The store module persists `distinctCount` / `nullCount` / `minValue` / `maxValue` for every column but keeps histograms only for columns it can actually seek on (a primary-key member or an index's leading column) — a dropped histogram costs a re-`ANALYZE` to recover and nothing else. Whatever you keep, keep it **keyed by column name**: a positional key silently matches a *different* column after a rename or drop.
- **Re-key your record when an ALTER frees a column name.** A name key is safer than a positional one but is not self-correcting: `rename column k to k2` — or `drop column k` — leaves your record naming `k`, and a later `add column k` reuses that name, so on reopen the stale entry describes a brand-new column. The engine cannot catch this for you (by then `k` names a column that genuinely exists), and it drops nothing of its own — a rename's entry is re-keyed in the in-memory catalog, not on your disk. So in your `alterTable`, move a renamed column's entry onto its new name and remove a dropped column's outright, then flush. The store module does exactly this from one dispatch-level call (`StoreTableBase.remapPersistedColumnStatistics`) rather than per ALTER arm, so a newly added arm has to face the question instead of skipping it silently.
- **Do not then report the saved snapshot from `getStatistics()`.** `ANALYZE` reads a non-empty `columnStats` as *"this module answered cheaply, skip the scan"*, so a module that echoes its own stored snapshot turns every `ANALYZE` into a no-op that re-saves numbers it never recomputed. A cached snapshot is not an answer to "analyze me". Get the loaded snapshot to the planner by stamping it onto the registered `TableSchema` at open instead (the store module does this from `primeStats`).

Statistics you persist are also **per-connection on the way back in**: a second connection over the same storage keeps whatever its own schema holds until it reopens or re-analyzes. That is the same visibility model a persisted row count already has.

A **wrapper** module (isolation, logging, sharding) must forward `getStatistics` *and* `saveStatistics` to the table it wraps — and forward them conditionally, since both are optional and an unconditional wrapper would answer on behalf of an underlying that declined. Forward only the half the underlying implements:

```typescript
if (underlying.saveStatistics) {
  this.saveStatistics = stats => underlying.saveStatistics!(stats);
}
```

## Update results and REPLACE displacement

`update()` returns an `UpdateResult`. On success (`{ status: 'ok', … }`) it reports what the call actually did through `row`, plus — via two **independent, additive, optional** channels — any rows this same call displaced through `OR REPLACE` conflict resolution. A module that reports neither displacement channel behaves exactly as it would have before they existed, so those two are purely opt-in; `row` is not.

```typescript
type UpdateResult =
  | { status: 'ok'; row?: Row; replacedRow?: Row; evictedRows?: readonly Row[] }
  | { status: 'constraint'; constraint: ConstraintType; message?: string; existingRow?: Row };
```

- **`row`** — **whether** you return it says a row really was written or removed; **what** you return is the row you stored. Leaving it out is how you report that nothing changed — a key-not-found UPDATE/DELETE, or a conflict you resolved as IGNORE — and the executor then skips the entire post-write pipeline and emits no row downstream. So return it on every real write, on all four operations. Its contents matter for INSERT/UPDATE: `row` is `args.values` after your own coercion to the declared column logical types. **If you coerce, return the coerced row.** The executor reports `row` — not the values it handed you — to every post-write consumer: `RETURNING`, change tracking, row-time materialized-view maintenance, FK cascades, and data-change events. Returning the raw input from a coercing module makes `RETURNING` disagree with a subsequent `select` of the same row (a `json` column would report the input TEXT while the table holds a parsed JSON value). Nothing is coerced above `update()`, so your pass is the only one — you will never be handed a value you already converted. A row whose width is not the table's column count makes the executor fall back to the proposed values. For DELETE the contents are never read (the OLD image comes from the source scan), so a PK-only placeholder is fine.
- **`replacedRow`** — the row displaced at the **same primary key** by a PK-collision REPLACE (the new row landed on an occupied PK; the old row had the same PK). The executor models it as an update-in-place of that PK slot: change-tracking as `update(replacedRow → newRow)` on the INSERT path (or `delete(replacedRow)` on a UPDATE move), with foreign-key actions fired as a *delete* of the old image.
- **`evictedRows`** — rows at **other primary keys** fully removed because REPLACE resolved a **non-PK UNIQUE** conflict for this same `update()` call. Report them in **user-facing schema** (no internal/overlay columns). The executor models **each** as a full DELETE — change-tracking, row-time materialized-view maintenance, foreign-key `ON DELETE` actions (CASCADE / SET NULL / …), and a delete event — fired **before** the new row's own bookkeeping, matching the substrate's evict-then-write order.

Report `evictedRows` whenever your `update()` internally deletes a row at a different PK to resolve a secondary-UNIQUE REPLACE; otherwise those cross-cutting effects (FK cascades, change subscriptions, events, covering-MV backing maintenance) silently do **not** run for the evicted row. Detection is necessarily module-specific (each module enumerates its current rows its own way), but the maintenance and cascades are **not** — reporting the eviction lets the engine's single post-write pipeline handle them uniformly. The two channels are independent and both appear on one result when a PK-collision REPLACE also evicts on a secondary UNIQUE: resolving the PK by REPLACE does **not** exempt the row from the table's other UNIQUE constraints — check each under its own action (statement OR > constraint default > ABORT) before writing, exactly as for a non-colliding insert. The executor handles both channels on one result.

> **`ON DELETE RESTRICT` / `NO ACTION` enforcement for evictions.** The executor enforces FK `RESTRICT` / `NO ACTION` for an evicted row alongside the FK *actions* (`CASCADE` / `SET NULL` / `SET DEFAULT`). The substrate has already physically deleted the row by the time it reports `evictedRows`, so there is no pre-mutation point to block at; instead the executor runs the transitive RESTRICT scan **post-eviction** (the child rows it keys off remain) and, on a violation, throws — the statement-scope savepoint then rolls back, unwinding both the eviction and the writing row. A secondary-UNIQUE REPLACE that would orphan a `RESTRICT` (or default `NO ACTION`) child therefore fails the statement and leaves data unchanged, matching SQLite. Enforced on the key-based memory, direct-store, and isolation-wrapped substrates; rowid-chained backends (lamina) remain out of scope (the post-eviction transitive recursion cannot dereference the already-removed parent), mirroring the documented SET-DEFAULT recursion gap.

## Mutation Statements

Virtual table modules can opt-in to receive deterministic mutation statements for each row-level operation. This enables replication, audit logging, and change data capture with guaranteed reproducibility.

### Overview

When a module sets `wantStatements: true`, Quereus provides a `mutationStatement` string with each `update()` call. This statement:

- Represents the **bottom-level mutation** at the VirtualTable.update() level (not the top-level DML statement)
- Contains all values as **literals** (no parameters; non-deterministic source expressions like `random()` or `datetime('now')` are already resolved to the concrete per-row values the engine evaluated)
- Includes **resolved mutation context** values as literals in the WITH CONTEXT clause
- Is the **audit / transport encoding** of the resolved per-row primitive that hit the module; replay is the act of applying that primitive at the same module boundary on another instance — not re-parsing the captured SQL through the full DML pipeline (re-execution would re-fire CHECKs, default evaluation, and generated-column computation, which is explicitly not the supported replay path)

### Module Opt-In

Modules enable mutation statements by setting a property:

```typescript
class MyReplicatedTable extends VirtualTable {
  // Opt-in to mutation statements
  wantStatements = true;

  async update(args: UpdateArgs): Promise<Row | undefined> {
    // args.mutationStatement contains the deterministic SQL statement
    if (args.mutationStatement) {
      await this.replicationLog.append(args.mutationStatement);
    }

    // Perform the actual mutation
    return this.performUpdate(args);
  }
}
```

### Statement Format

Mutation statements use Quereus SQL syntax with all values as literals:

**INSERT Example:**
```sql
-- Original statement with parameters
insert into orders (id, amount) values (:id, :amount)

-- Logged mutation statement (per row)
insert into orders (id, amount) values (1, 100)
```

**INSERT with Mutation Context:**
```sql
-- Original statement
insert into orders (id, amount, created_at)
with context now = datetime('now')
values (1, 100, now)

-- Logged mutation statement (context resolved to literal)
insert into orders (id, amount, created_at) with context now = '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z' values (1, 100, '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z')
```

**UPDATE Example:**
```sql
-- Original statement
update users set name = :newName where id = :userId

-- Logged mutation statement (per row)
update users set name = 'Alice' where id = 1
```

**DELETE Example:**
```sql
-- Original statement
delete from sessions where user_id = :userId

-- Logged mutation statement (per row)
delete from sessions where user_id = 42 and session_id = 'abc123'
```

### Determinism Guarantees

The mutation statement system ensures determinism by:

1. **Resolving Execution Parameters**: All `:name` and `?` parameters are replaced with their literal values
2. **Resolving Mutation Context**: All context variables are evaluated once per statement and emitted as literals
3. **Resolving Defaults / Generated Columns**: DEFAULT and `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` expressions are evaluated per row and emitted as literal values — this is true even when the source expressions contain non-deterministic functions (allowed under `pragma nondeterministic_schema = true`; see [Determinism Validation](determinism.md))
4. **Preserving Order**: Mutations are logged in the order they're applied to the virtual table

Replay then means: take the captured primitive and re-apply it at the module boundary (e.g. feed `mutationStatement` rows back through `vtab.update()` on the replica), not re-execute the SQL through the full DML pipeline. The atomicity of the original commit — including deferred CHECKs that were evaluated once at commit time — is preserved by replaying the transaction's writes as a unit.

### Use Cases

**Replication:**
```typescript
class ReplicatedTable extends VirtualTable {
  wantStatements = true;

  async update(args: UpdateArgs): Promise<Row | undefined> {
    // Send mutation to replicas
    await this.replicator.broadcast(args.mutationStatement!);

    // Apply locally
    return this.storage.update(args);
  }
}
```

**Audit Logging:**
```typescript
class AuditedTable extends VirtualTable {
  wantStatements = true;

  async update(args: UpdateArgs): Promise<Row | undefined> {
    // Log mutation with timestamp and user
    await this.auditLog.record({
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      user: this.currentUser,
      statement: args.mutationStatement!
    });

    return this.storage.update(args);
  }
}
```

**Change Data Capture:**
```typescript
class CDCTable extends VirtualTable {
  wantStatements = true;

  async update(args: UpdateArgs): Promise<Row | undefined> {
    // Publish change event
    await this.eventBus.publish({
      table: this.tableName,
      operation: args.operation,
      statement: args.mutationStatement!
    });

    return this.storage.update(args);
  }
}
```

The database-level event system a module feeds — `getEventEmitter()`, the auto-event path,
transaction batching, and the row-shape / table-name / row-key contract across mid-transaction
ALTER — is documented separately in [Database-Level Event System](module-events.md).

**A module that raises its own data-change events owes two more guarantees**, on top of the
as-of-delivery ones above. A module without an emitter owes nothing here: the engine's
auto-event path produces both for it.

- **`key` is the primary key projected out of the event's own row image** — out of `newRow` for
  an `insert` and an `update`, out of `oldRow` for a `delete`. Never the pre-image key of an
  update, and never a key your storage layer normalized away from the values the row holds.
- **An `update` event never moves a row.** If a write relocates a row — its key values differ
  under the primary key's own comparator, which is per-column collation- and type-aware, not
  byte identity — emit a `delete` at the old key followed by an `insert` at the new key, in
  that order, instead of one `update`. Test relocation with the same comparator (or the same
  encoded key) your storage uses to address rows, never raw value equality: under a `NOCASE`
  key, rewriting `'apple'` to `'APPLE'` moves nothing and stays a single `update`, keyed by
  the post-image. Consumers are promised the ordering but **not** adjacency, so you may
  interleave other events between the pair.

Both are what lets a listener retire a row's old identity without knowing which columns form
the key — see [usage § Subscribing to Data Changes](usage.md#subscribing-to-data-changes).
