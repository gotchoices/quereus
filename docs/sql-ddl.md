## 2.0 Declarative Schema (Optional, Order-Independent)

> **Stability: Beta** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

Quereus keeps traditional DDL fully intact. Declarative schema is an optional alternative for describing the desired end‑state in a single, order‑independent block. Modules continue to use DDL‑based interfaces; declarative workflows operate entirely in the engine and produce DDL.

**Concepts:**
- **Schema**: Named logical grouping of objects; may span multiple modules.
- **Catalog**: The set of objects owned by a module; may span multiple schemas.
- **Diff**: JSON representation of changes needed to align actual state with declared schema.
- **Apply**: Automatic execution of migration DDL statements.

**Key Statements:**

1. `declare schema` – Describes desired end‑state and stores declaration with optional seed data.
2. `diff schema` – Compares declared schema with current state and returns JSON diff.
3. `apply schema` – Executes the generated migration DDL, optionally applying seed data.
4. `explain schema` – Returns the schema content hash for versioning.

### Declaration Syntax

```sql
declare schema schema_name
  [version 'major.minor.patch']
  [using (default_vtab_module = 'memory', default_vtab_args = '{}')]
{
  -- Tables: use {...} or (...) for column definitions
  table users {
    id integer primary key,
    email text not null unique,
    name text not null,
    created_at text not null default (datetime('now'))
  }
  
  -- Or with explicit USING clause
  table sessions (
    id text primary key,
    user_id integer not null,
    expires_at integer
  ) using memory;

  table roles {
    id integer primary key,
    name text not null unique
  }

  -- Table-level `with tags` trails the column body (see 2.6.3); columns and
  -- constraints carry their own tags inline.
  table audit_log {
    id integer primary key with tags (display_name = 'Audit ID')
  } with tags ("quereus.id" = 'tbl-audit-log')

  table user_roles (
    user_id integer not null,
    role_id integer not null,
    constraint pk_user_roles primary key (user_id, role_id),
    constraint fk_user foreign key (user_id) references users(id),
    constraint fk_role foreign key (role_id) references roles(id)
  );

  -- Indexes (optional `unique`, optional partial `where`, optional `with tags`)
  index users_email on users(email);
  unique index users_active_email on users(email) where created_at is not null;

  -- Views
  view v_user_roles as
    select u.id as user_id, u.email, r.name as role
    from users u join user_roles ur on u.id = ur.user_id
                 join roles r on ur.role_id = r.id;

  -- Seed data: ( (row1_values), (row2_values), ... )
  seed roles (
    (1, 'admin'),
    (2, 'viewer')
  )
  
  -- Or with explicit column names
  seed users values (id, email, name) values
    (1, 'admin@example.com', 'Admin'),
    (2, 'viewer@example.com', 'Viewer');

  -- Assertions: enforced at commit time
  assertion positive_balance check (not exists (select 1 from users where balance < 0))

  -- Future: domains, collations, and imports
  -- domain email_address as text check (like(value, '%@%'));
  -- collation nocase = nocase();
  -- import schema auth from 'https://example.com/auth-schema.sql' cache 'auth@1' version '^2';
}
```

#### Item keywords and bare aliases

Items in a declaration block need no separator, so the leading keyword of an item
sits exactly where the previous item's body would accept a bare (no-`as`) alias.
To keep the boundary unambiguous, an item keyword — `table`, `index`, `unique`,
`materialized`, `view`, `seed`, `assertion`, `domain`, `collation`, `import` —
cannot be used as a *bare* alias at a position where an item could begin:

```sql
declare schema main {
  view v1 as select id from t1 materialized   -- `materialized` is NOT an alias here
  materialized view m2 as select id from t1
}
```

If you want one of those words as an alias inside a declaration block, write it
explicitly (`from t1 as materialized`), quote it (`from t1 "materialized"`), or
separate the items with `;`. Outside a declaration block nothing is reserved:
`select a from t1 materialized` still aliases `t1` as `materialized`.

The restriction applies only where an item could actually begin — the item body's
top level. Inside an open `(` (a subquery source, a scalar subquery) a bare alias
is unaffected:

```sql
declare schema main {
  view v1 as select id from t1 where exists (select 1 from t2 materialized)
}                                                          -- ^ still an alias
```

An item kind the parser doesn't model yet (`domain`, `collation`, `import`) is
skipped up to the next `;`, the closing `}`, or the next item keyword — separate
those items with `;` when their body could itself contain an item keyword.

### Diffing and Applying

```sql
-- Get migration DDL as result rows (one DDL statement per row)
diff schema main;
-- Returns rows like:
--   {"ddl": "create table users (...)"}
--   {"ddl": "drop table old_table"}
-- Returns no rows if schema is already aligned

-- Execute DDL yourself with custom migration logic
-- TypeScript example:
--   for await (const {ddl} of db.eval('diff schema main')) {
--     console.log('Executing:', ddl);
--     await db.exec(ddl);
--     // Insert custom backfill/transform logic here
--   }

-- Or use apply to execute automatically (no result rows)
apply schema main;

-- Apply with seed data (clears and repopulates)
apply schema main with seed;

-- Get schema hash for versioning
explain schema main;
-- Returns: {"info": "hash:a1b2c3d4e5f6"}

-- Future: versioned apply with options
apply schema main to version '1.0.0' options (
  allow_destructive = false,
  rename_policy = 'require-hint'
);
```

### Semantics and Features

**Order Independence:**
- Tables, indexes, and views can be declared in any order within the `{...}` block.
- Forward references are allowed (e.g., foreign keys to tables declared later).

**Each declared name appears once.** A repeated name used to last-writer-wins silently, so the first declaration never reached the migration. `diff schema` / `apply schema` now reject it up front, naming the object:
- `table`, `view`, and `materialized view` share **one** namespace — the engine enforces it imperatively too (`create view` refuses a name a table holds, and vice versa), so a cross-kind clash could only ever half-apply and then fail mid-migration. Both the same-kind and the cross-kind case are errors:
  ```sql
  -- error: Table 't1' is declared more than once in schema 'main'
  -- error: 'dual' is declared as both a table and a view in schema 'main'
  ```
- `index` has its own namespace (unique per schema — see [sql-vtab.md §6.3](sql-vtab.md#63-indexes-on-virtual-tables)), as does `assertion`. An index or assertion may share a table's name; only a duplicate *within* its own namespace is rejected.
- A repeated `seed` block for one table is rejected when the declaration is stored, not at diff time — two blocks for one table have no defined meaning, and the second used to discard the first's rows:
  ```sql
  -- error: Seed data for table 't1' is declared more than once in schema 'main'
  ```
- Names compare case-insensitively, so `table T1` and `table t1` collide.

**Flexible Syntax:**
- Column definitions accept brace syntax `{...}` or traditional parentheses `(...)`.
- Identifiers are only quoted when they are reserved keywords or contain special characters.

**Schema Diffing:**
- Compares the declared schema against the current database catalog.
- Generates a JSON diff showing tables/views/indexes to create, drop, or alter.
- Produces canonical DDL statements for all required changes.

**Migration Application:**
- `apply schema` executes the migration DDL automatically.
- Migrations are applied in safe order: drops first, then creates, then alters.
- Seed data application: `with seed` clears existing data and inserts declared seed rows.

**Versioning and Hashing:**
- Schema declarations can include semantic versions.
- `explain schema` computes a SHA-256 hash of the canonical schema representation.
- Enables tracking schema changes and ensuring consistency across environments.

**Options (`OPTIONS (...)`):**

`allow_destructive` (boolean literal `true` / `false`) and `rename_policy` (string) are the only keys accepted; both are described below. Anything else is a parse error — an unrecognized key, or a non-boolean value for `allow_destructive`. Silently dropping an option the engine will not honor would run the full migration anyway, which is precisely what the caller was trying to avoid. `dry_run` and `validate_only` were accepted-and-ignored by earlier builds and are now rejected by name: use `diff schema` for a read-only preview of the exact migration DDL. There is no engine-level dry-run or validate-only mode.

**Safety:**
- Seed data application is destructive (clears table before inserting).
- `allow_destructive` is **enforced for one case today**: a backing-module change on a maintained table (`materialized view … using <module>` or `create table … maintained as … using <module>`). Such a move physically relocates the table to a different store with no in-place primitive, so it is realized as a `DROP TABLE` + `create materialized view … using <newmodule>` that **mints a new incarnation** (changing row identity for a replicated/synced table). `apply schema` aborts — before any DDL runs — unless re-run with `options (allow_destructive = true)`:

  ```sql
  -- Re-declared with a moved backing module; refused without the ack:
  apply schema main;
  -- Error: backing-module change on maintained table(s) 'mv' is destructive
  --        (drop + recreate, new incarnation). Re-run with options
  --        (allow_destructive = true) to migrate the backing.

  -- Acknowledged — drops + recreates, re-materializing the body into the new module:
  apply schema main options (allow_destructive = true);
  ```

  `diff schema` surfaces the `DROP TABLE` / `create materialized view` DDL unconditionally (it is a read-only preview, never gated). Other drops are **not yet** gated — a general `allow_destructive` gate over all destructive schema changes remains future work.
- Rename hints prevent accidental drops during renames — see "Rename detection" below.

**Rename detection (`rename_policy`):**

`apply schema` understands rename hints carried via the reserved `quereus.id` and `quereus.previous_name` tags (see §2.6.3). The `rename_policy` option in `OPTIONS (...)` controls how strictly the differ behaves when names change:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `'allow'` (default) | Use hints when present; without hints, fall through to drop+create. |
| `'require-hint'` | Reject any name change that lacks a hint — if drops *and* creates of the same kind both remain after rename matching, error rather than executing destructive DDL. |
| `'deny'` | Ignore hints entirely. Any name mismatch becomes drop+create. Escape hatch for opting back into the legacy behavior. |

A rename detected via `quereus.id` is authoritative: when both `id` and `previous_name` would resolve, `id` wins. A *conflict* — declared name and the hint resolving to two distinct existing actuals — is always an error regardless of policy.

Renames apply to tables, views, indexes, named constraints (CHECK / UNIQUE / FOREIGN KEY, either table-level `CONSTRAINT <name> ...` or a column-level constraint carrying a name), and columns. Tables and columns rename via the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` / `RENAME COLUMN` primitives, which propagate references through dependent CHECK expressions, FK targets, partial-index predicates, column `DEFAULT` / `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` expressions, view bodies, materialized-view bodies, and assertion CHECK expressions. Named constraints rename via the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME CONSTRAINT` primitive. The differ also detects constraint **drops** (a named constraint present in the catalog but absent from the declaration → `DROP CONSTRAINT`) and **adds** (a declared named constraint absent from the catalog → `ADD CONSTRAINT`; CHECK applies in place, UNIQUE / FK adds depend on module support — see §2.7). Only **user-named** constraints participate — engine-synthesized names (the `_check_*` / `_fk_*` / `_uc_*` auto-names for unnamed constraints) and UNIQUE constraints derived from a `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` are excluded (the latter are managed through their index). View and index renames still fall back to drop+recreate when no rename primitive exists.

**Notes:**
- Keywords `schema`, `version`, and `seed` are contextual and don't conflict with column names or function calls like `schema()`.
- DDL remains the primary interface; declarative schema is a convenience layer that generates DDL.
- Modules are unaware of declarative schemas; they receive standard DDL commands.


## 2.6 CREATE TABLE Statement

The create table statement defines a new table structure.  Note that all tables are "without rowid" implicitly.

**Syntax:**
```sql
create table [if not exists] table_name (
  column_definition [, column_definition...]
  [, table_constraint...]
)
[using module_name [(module_args...)]]
[with tags (key = value [, ...])]
```

**Column Definition:**
```sql
column_name [data_type] [column_constraint...] [with tags (key = value [, ...])]
```

**Column Constraints:**
```sql
[constraint name]
{ primary key [asc | desc] [conflict_clause] [autoincrement]
| not null [conflict_clause]
| unique [conflict_clause]
| check [on {insert | update | delete}[,...]] (expr)
| default value
| collate collation_name
| references foreign_table [(column[,...])] [ref_actions]
| generated always as (expr) [stored | virtual] }
[with tags (key = value [, ...])]
```

**Table Constraints:**
```sql
[constraint name]
{ primary key ([column [asc | desc][,...]]) [conflict_clause]
| unique (column[,...]) [conflict_clause]
| check [on {insert | update | delete}[,...]] (expr)
| foreign key (column[,...]) references foreign_table [(column[,...])] [ref_actions] }
[with tags (key = value [, ...])]
```

**Conflict Clause:**
```sql
on conflict { rollback | abort | fail | ignore | replace }
```

**Options:**
- If an empty key column list is provided, the table may have 0 or 1 rows.
- `if not exists`: Creates the table only if it doesn't already exist
- `column_definition`: Defines a column with optional constraints
- `table_constraint`: Defines a table-level constraint
- `using module_name`: Specifies a virtual table module

**Persistability:**

Before the table is created, every registered virtual-table module is asked whether it
could durably persist the resulting definition, and the first refusal fails the statement —
the table is never created, no storage is left behind. This guards against a definition
whose generated DDL text a storage backend cannot write down (today's only instance: a
JavaScript string carrying a lone/unpaired surrogate — in the table name, a quoted column
name, a `default` string literal, or a `check` constant — has no valid UTF-8 encoding, which
the persistent store's catalog requires). Without this check the create would otherwise
succeed, and — since the catalog write it depends on is fire-and-forget — a table nobody
ever reads or writes again would simply vanish on the next reopen with no error at all. See
[store.md](store.md) and [view-persistence.md](view-persistence.md) for the underlying
mechanism, which `CREATE VIEW` / `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` / `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` also use.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Basic table with constraints
create table employees (
  id integer primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text unique collate nocase,
  department text default 'General',
  salary real check (salary >= 0),
  hire_date text,
  manager_id integer references employees(id)
);

-- Table with composite key and multiple constraints
create table order_items (
  order_id integer,
  product_id integer,
  quantity integer not null check on insert (quantity > 0),
  price real not null check (price >= 0),
  discount real default 0 check (discount >= 0 and discount <= 1),
  primary key (order_id, product_id),
  foreign key (order_id) references orders(id),
  foreign key (product_id) references products(id)
);

-- Memory-backed virtual table
create table cache (
  key text primary key,
  value blob,
  expires_at integer
) using memory;

-- Table with generated (computed) columns
create table products (
  id integer primary key,
  base_price integer not null,
  tax_rate real not null default 0.1,
  total_price real generated always as (base_price * (1 + tax_rate)) stored,
  label text generated always as ('Product #' || id) virtual
);
```

**Generated Columns:**

Generated columns are computed from an expression over other columns in the same row:

- `STORED`: The value is computed at INSERT/UPDATE time and persisted. Reads return the stored value directly.
- `VIRTUAL`: Semantically computed on read (currently stored identically to STORED; storage optimization is planned).
- If neither `STORED` nor `VIRTUAL` is specified, `VIRTUAL` is the default.
- Generated column expressions must be deterministic. They may reference any column of the same table, including other generated columns; their dependency graph must be acyclic and self-references are rejected at `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` time.
- A name in a generated expression resolves against the table being defined **unless a `FROM` clause inside the expression binds it** — the same rule a CHECK constraint follows. `(select v from d where d.k = id limit 1)` reads `d.v` without qualification, and a generated column may read another table's column that shares its own name without creating a false cycle. A name bound by nothing — a bare typo, or an unrebound `new.<name>` that is not a column — is rejected at DDL time. Because a name a `FROM` binds belongs to that source, a column of another table can be dropped or renamed only with the generated expression accounted for: the drop is refused and the rename rewrites the body, exactly as for a qualified reference.
- **How a generated expression may spell its own row's columns.** Four spellings are accepted, and they mean the same thing wherever the body is compiled — at `CREATE TABLE`, at `INSERT`, at `UPDATE`, in an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` recompute, and in an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` backfill. A declaration the engine accepts is therefore one every subsequent write accepts.

  | spelling | accepted | meaning |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `<column>` | yes | the column of the row being written |
  | `<table>.<column>` | yes | same — the self-qualifier is folded away before the expression is resolved |
  | `<own-schema>.<table>.<column>` | yes | same, provided the schema named is the table's own |
  | `new.<column>` | yes | same — an exact alias for the bare form |
  | `old.<column>` | **no** | a generated value is computed from the row being *written*; there is no old row to compute it from, and the backfill of an `ADD COLUMN` has no old row at all |
  | any other qualifier | no | resolved through the ordinary scope chain, so it fails unless a `FROM` inside the expression binds it |

  `new` and `old` are not reserved words, so a subquery inside the body that names a real table called `"new"` reads that table: the subquery's own `FROM` binds the name first.

  Whatever the spelling, the column is read **already converted to its own declared type** — the form that will be stored, not the form the write spelled (see [types.md](types.md)). That holds for a generated column reading another generated column too, so every compilation site listed above computes from the same values.

  **An unbindable qualified reference is rejected at declaration time, by both statements.** `old.<column>`, or `<some other table>.<column>` with no `FROM` inside the body binding it, is rejected the moment the table is declared — by `CREATE TABLE` and by `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` alike, with the same message — and the table is left uncreated (`CREATE TABLE`) or unchanged (`ADD COLUMN`). The two surfaces always agree: neither accepts a declaration the other rejects. The one case that still reaches the first write is a qualifier sitting inside a body the analysis cannot read — a CTE body, a derived table, or a nested `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` — where "nothing binds it" is undecidable and the declaration is accepted rather than refused on a guess. Prefer spelling the row's own columns with one of the four accepted forms above.

  The same undecidability cuts the other way for a **self**-reference: a name inside one of those bodies might be this table's own column, and the analysis records the dependency rather than guess it away. So `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN g GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...)` whose body spells `g` anywhere inside a nested `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` — its `RETURNING` list, an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` assignment, a `WITH CONTEXT` assignment — is rejected as a cycle, even though that `g` names the nested statement's table. Qualifying the reference does not help — the analysis cannot resolve a qualifier in there either — so give the column a different name.
- **Mutation-context variables do not shadow a column here.** In a `CHECK` or a column `DEFAULT`, a `with context (...)` variable claims the bare name and the column stays reachable as `new.<column>` (§2.6.2). A generated expression is deliberately different: the bare name always means the column. Its value is a pure function of the row being written and must compute identically at all the sites above, and the `ADD COLUMN` backfill has no mutation-context envelope to read. Nothing is lost by this: a bare name in a generated body that is not a column of the table is already rejected at DDL time, so a generated body can only ever collide with a context variable, never usefully name one.
- Cannot have both `DEFAULT` and `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` on the same column.
- Cannot INSERT into or UPDATE a generated column directly.
- `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...)` **backfills the existing rows**: each one's value is computed from that row, exactly as `CREATE TABLE` with the same declaration and a subsequent INSERT would produce it. This holds for the `STORED`, `VIRTUAL` and unspecified spellings alike, and for an expression that reads another generated column (already materialized in the stored row). Determinism is checked at declaration time — `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` alike, before any row is touched — so `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (random())` is rejected there rather than at the next INSERT, whichever statement declares it (unless `nondeterministic_schema` is on). If the new column is `NOT NULL` and the expression yields NULL for some existing row, or an inline `CHECK` on it fails for some existing row, the whole `ALTER` is rejected and the table is left exactly as it was.
- `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN` of a column referenced by another generated column's expression is rejected; drop the referencing generated column first. (A column that a foreign key in another table points at is rejected the same way — see [sql-constraints.md §7.6](sql-constraints.md#76-foreign-key-constraint).)

**CHECK Constraints:**

- `check (expr)` is enforced on INSERT and UPDATE by default; `check on {insert | update | delete}[,...]` restricts the operations. Unqualified columns name the NEW row (the OLD row for DELETE-only checks); `old.<col>` / `new.<col>` reference either row image explicitly. Both spellings are equivalent as far as ALTER goes: `RENAME COLUMN` rewrites `new.<col>` / `old.<col>` references along with the unqualified ones, `DROP COLUMN` refuses over them (see below), and `ADD CONSTRAINT … CHECK` validates a `new.<col>` reference against the existing rows exactly like the bare form — while a conjunct referencing `old.<col>`, being a rule about the previous row image, is not validated and does not block the statement ([§2.7](sql-alter.md)). `new` and `old` are not reserved words, so a CHECK subquery reading a real table named `"new"` is left alone by both — and the qualifier always names the row of the table that **owns** the CHECK, so altering a table that happens to be called `new` or `old` neither rewrites another table's `new.<col>` / `old.<col>` nor is blocked by one.
- Comparisons inside a CHECK resolve **declared column collations** (and explicit `COLLATE` wrappers), exactly like the same expression in a query — `check (c = 'abc')` over a `text collate nocase` column accepts any case-variant. Resolution follows the engine's symmetric provenance lattice (explicit `COLLATE` > declared column collation > defaulted collation > BINARY; see `docs/types.md` § Comparison collation resolution), so `check (b = c)` and `check (c = b)` behave identically.
- A CHECK containing a subquery is automatically deferred to transaction commit; the deferred evaluation runs the same compiled predicate, so collation semantics are identical to the immediate path.
- `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN` of a column a CHECK expression names is rejected — there is no narrowed form of an arbitrary expression, only deleting it silently or refusing. Drop the constraint first (`ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT <name>`); an *unnamed* table-level CHECK has no name to address, so a column it names can only be removed by rebuilding the table. The same holds for a live **assertion** whose CHECK body names the column (`DROP ASSERTION <name>` first) — there the refusal also prevents one broken body from blocking writes to every table in the database. Detection is scope-aware, so a like-named column reached only through a subquery over *another* table does not block the drop. See [sql-alter.md § 2.7](sql-alter.md#27-alter-table-statement) under *DROP COLUMN* for the structural-vs-expression rule these restrictions come from.
- The scan covers **every table in every schema**, not just the altered one, and follows **view and materialized-view bodies to any depth**. A CHECK may contain a subquery, so another table's constraint can legitimately read this column — directly (`check (n < (select max(v) from t))` on some table `x`) or through a view over it (`check (n < (select max(v) from vv))` where `vv` is `select id, v from t`); dropping `t.v` out from under either would leave `x` unwritable, with an error naming neither `t`, nor `v`, nor the constraint. The refusal names the referencing table, schema-qualified when it lives elsewhere, and — when the reference is indirect — the chain it travelled: `CHECK constraint 'ck1' on table 'x' reaches it through view 'v2' -> view 'v1'`.
- **`DROP TABLE` / `DROP VIEW` / `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` refuses the same class**, for the same reason and with the same scope and chain-following: `cannot drop table 'main.t': it is referenced by CHECK constraint 'ck1' on table 'x' — drop or redefine it first`, or `cannot drop table 'main.t': CHECK constraint 'ck1' on table 'x' reaches it through view 'vv' — drop or redefine it first`. `IF EXISTS` does not weaken it (that clause governs absence, not dependency). A table's *own* self-referencing CHECK never blocks its own drop — the constraint goes away with the table. Dropping a table out from under a plain **view** stays legal and leaves the view broken (a broken view breaks queries of that view; a broken CHECK makes a whole table unwritable) — but dropping a *view* that a CHECK subquery reads, directly or through a further view, is refused, because there the referencing table is what breaks.

**Default Values:**

A column `DEFAULT` supplies the value when an INSERT omits the column; an explicitly supplied value always wins. The expression must be deterministic and may not reference bind parameters.

- A default may read a sibling **the INSERT supplies** via `new.<column>` — e.g. `slug text default (lower(new.title))` or `total integer default (new.subtotal + tax)`. Only INSERT-supplied columns are visible, so a default never depends on another column's default (which would impose an evaluation-order race); referencing an omitted column raises a resolution error. The same `new.<column>` surface also resolves at the **shared-key view-write envelope** (an anchor key default reading a supplied sibling — see [vu-mutation-context.md § Mutation context](vu-mutation-context.md#mutation-context)). A sibling read this way arrives **already converted to its own declared type** — the form that will be stored, not the form the INSERT spelled (see [types.md](types.md)) — so a default over a `json` sibling sees parsed JSON, and INSERT, UPDATE, upsert recompute, and `ADD COLUMN` backfill all hand the expression the same value.
- A **bare** (unqualified) column reference is rejected at `CREATE TABLE` — use `new.<column>` to read a supplied value, or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` to compute from any sibling. (With a `with context (...)` clause an unqualified identifier may instead resolve to a mutation-context variable.)
- A `new.<column>` default survives ALTER exactly as a CHECK's does: `RENAME COLUMN` rewrites the reference (so the table keeps accepting rows), and `DROP COLUMN` refuses over it, naming the column whose default is in the way. `new` is not a reserved word, so a default whose subquery reads a real table named `"new"` is left alone by both. Both spellings of the ALTER — the inline `default (…)` and `ALTER COLUMN … SET DEFAULT` — write the same catalog field and behave identically here.
- A default (and a `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` body) on **another table** that reads this one through a subquery — `w integer default ((select min(v) from t))` — is scanned and refused the same way a CHECK is, by both `DROP COLUMN` and `DROP TABLE`. See *CHECK Constraints* above.
- `mutation_ordinal()` (the 1-based per-row ordinal) and mutation-context variables are also available in default position. See [vu-mutation-context.md § Mutation context](vu-mutation-context.md#mutation-context).
- `ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN … SET DEFAULT` routes the new default through the **same** validator `CREATE TABLE` uses: bind parameters / bare columns / non-deterministic expressions are rejected at `ALTER` time, and a `new.<column>` default is accepted (its build is deferred to INSERT time, exactly as on `CREATE TABLE`). `DROP DEFAULT` clears the default.
- `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN … DEFAULT (…)` accepts the same default expressions (the shared validator rejects bind parameters / bare columns / non-determinism). Existing rows are **backfilled per row**: `new.<column>` resolves to the *existing* row's sibling (e.g. `add column doubled integer default (new.base * 2)` sets each existing row's `doubled` from its own `base`), while a literal default is bulk-written. Future inserts derive the column from the INSERT-supplied sibling, so an insert that omits that sibling raises the same resolution error as the single-source path. An `ADD COLUMN NOT NULL` whose per-row backfill yields NULL for any existing row is rejected and the column is not added. DEFAULT is not the only backfilled kind: `ADD COLUMN … GENERATED ALWAYS AS (…)` takes the same per-row route (see *Generated Columns*), except that it never bulk-writes — even a constant generated expression is evaluated per row, since a generated column has no DEFAULT for the module to write.

**ADD COLUMN over a non-empty table needs a value for the rows that already exist.**

`ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` is rejected — before any schema or data is touched — when the table already holds rows, the new column is NOT NULL, and nothing supplies a value for those rows. Three points are easy to trip over:

- **NOT NULL is resolved, not read off the statement text.** A column is NOT NULL either because it says `not null` or because the session option `default_column_nullability` (see [usage.md § Database Options](usage.md#database-options)) makes it so; that option ships as `not_null`, so `add column extra text` and `add column extra text default null` are both mandatory columns unless you write `null` explicitly.
- **A DEFAULT that is literally NULL supplies no value.** `default null` (and `default (null)`) counts as "no DEFAULT" for this rule, because filling the existing rows with NULL is exactly what the column forbids. Write `add column extra text null default null` if you want the column to be optional.
- **A per-row source does count.** A non-foldable expression default (`default (new.other)`) or a `generated always as (…)` expression fills each existing row from that row; the ALTER proceeds, and NOT NULL is then enforced against each computed value (a row yielding NULL rejects the whole ALTER).

On an **empty** table any of these is accepted — there is nothing to backfill — and NOT NULL enforces from the first write, matching SQLite. Both shipped storage modules (memory and the persistent store) give the same answer for the same statement. A storage module that carries pre-existing rows forward and enforces NOT NULL at write time can opt out of this engine-level rejection with the `delegatesNotNullBackfill` capability, in which case the module decides.

## 2.6.1 CREATE/DROP ASSERTION (Global Integrity Constraints)

Quereus supports database-wide integrity assertions evaluated at COMMIT time.

Syntax:
```sql
create assertion [schema_name.]assertion_name check (condition_expression);
drop assertion [if exists] [schema_name.]assertion_name;
```

Behavior:
- An assertion belongs to a schema. An unqualified name means the current schema, matching every other DDL statement; names are unique per schema, so two schemas may each hold an assertion of the same name and both enforce independently.
- The stored CHECK body resolves its unqualified table names against the assertion's **own** schema first, independent of the session's search path — the same home-schema rule stored view and materialized-view bodies follow (see `sql-select.md` § 2.1.1).
- The CHECK body is **validated at create time**, at exactly the strictness a `CREATE VIEW` body is validated: the derived violation SQL is planned under the assertion's home-schema path, so a body naming a missing table, a missing column, or an unknown function fails the `CREATE ASSERTION` (`Cannot create assertion 'a1': Table 't' not found …`). Anything the planner accepts for a view body is accepted here too — a type mismatch such as `x + 'abc'` is not a planner error and still creates. This matters because enforcement recompiles **every** live assertion on any commit that touched any table, so an assertion that cannot be planned would otherwise block writes to the whole database at some unrelated later statement.
- For the same reason, `DROP TABLE` / `DROP VIEW` / `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` is **refused** while a live assertion can still reach the object: `cannot drop table 'main.t': assertion 'a1' still refers to it — drop or redefine the assertion first`. `IF EXISTS` does not weaken this (it governs absence, not dependency). The refusal is a clean no-op; `drop assertion a1` then lets the drop through. "Refers to" is decided by the same walk `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` uses to rewrite dependent bodies, so a name a CTE or a FROM alias merely shadows is not a reference and does not block the drop.
- The refusal follows **view and materialized-view chains**, to any depth: an assertion reading `v` where `create view v as select * from t` blocks `drop table t`, and the message names the chain — `assertion 'a1' reaches it through view 'v2' -> view 'v1'`. Each body in the chain resolves its own unqualified names under its own home schema.
- The refusal consults assertions in **every** schema, not only the dropped object's. An assertion in `temp` naming `main.t` — explicitly, or by a bare name that resolves down its home path to `main.t` — blocks the drop, and the message qualifies the assertion (`assertion 'temp.a1'`) so the user can find the one to drop. An assertion in `temp` whose bare `t` means `temp.t` is left alone.
- `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` is refused on the same reach, probing every body in the chain for the column by name: `Cannot drop column 'x' from 't': it is referenced by assertion 'a1' through view 'v' — drop or redefine the assertion first`. An assertion body that names the table but not the column is no obstacle — including a `select *` body, which names no column at all.
- The column verb follows column **republication** too: each body in the chain is probed not only against the altered table but against every view / materialized view that re-exposes the dropped column as one of its own output columns — the same lineage the `RENAME COLUMN` cascade re-targets on (see [sql-alter.md § 2.7](sql-alter.md#27-alter-table-statement)). So a star re-exposure (`create view v as select * from t`, `select t.*`, or a materialized view of either), which spells the column's name nowhere, still blocks `alter table t drop column x` under `create assertion a1 check (… from v where x < 0)`. Two arms of that rule are worth knowing:
  - A view with an **explicit column list** over a covering star (`create view v(a, b) as select * from t`) never shifts a published name — but dropping any starred-over column changes the arity the star produces and breaks the view **outright**, every column of it. An assertion whose reach names such a view at all is refused, and the message says the view breaks entirely rather than pointing at a column name no body spells.
  - For a **materialized view** the refusal is deliberately conservative: its backing table keeps its own columns, so the assertion would in fact have kept compiling and running — against frozen contents, with the MV marked stale and its next `refresh materialized view` failing. The engine refuses anyway, keeping one rule for views and materialized views and erring the same direction `DROP TABLE` does for the same object.
- An **aliased** FROM source is no obstacle to any of the above: an alias adds a qualifier, it does not take the source's columns out of scope, so an assertion body reading `select 1 from t a where x < 0` — or a view republishing through `select * from t a` — is seen exactly as the unaliased spelling is.
- Known limit on the column verb: an inline **subquery source** (`from (select …) s`) and a **function source** have no askable column set — inferring it would mean analysing the inner body recursively — so a republication arriving only that way (`create view v as select * from (select * from t) s`) is invisible and the drop is accepted, after which the assertion fails every write to the whole database. Where the inner subquery *spells* the column the drop guard does see it, but `RENAME COLUMN` still does not follow the outer reference. See [sql-alter.md § DROP COLUMN](sql-alter.md#27-alter-table-statement); tracked by `bug-column-verbs-blind-to-star-over-subquery-source`.
- Assertions are enforced at COMMIT. Any row produced by the stored violation query indicates a violation and the COMMIT fails with a constraint error (transaction rolled back). The error names the assertion, schema-qualified outside `main` (`Integrity assertion failed: sales.a1`).
- The `check (expr)` is stored as a violation SQL: `select 1 where not (expr)`.
- `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` / `RENAME COLUMN` rewrites the stored body and regenerates that violation SQL, so the assertion keeps enforcing the same rule against the renamed object — the same in-place propagation view and materialized-view bodies get, in every schema (see [sql-alter.md § 2.7](sql-alter.md#27-alter-table-statement) for how a reference is decided to be a reference).
- Efficiency: The optimizer classifies each table reference instance in the violation query as row-specific (unique key fully covered) or global. If any changed base is global, run the violation SQL once. Otherwise, for row-specific references, the engine executes per changed primary key using prepared parameters (`pk0`, `pk1`, ... for composite keys), early-exiting on the first violation.

Diagnostics:
- Use `explain_assertion(name)` to introspect classification and prepared parameterization. The argument may be `'schema.name'` (schema-scoped) or a bare name (first match across schemas).
- `assertion_info()` lists all assertions with their `schema_name`.

Examples:
```sql
-- Global-style assertion (aggregate)
create table t2 (id integer primary key) using memory;
create assertion a_global check ((select count(*) from t2) = (select count(*) from t2));
select exists(
  select 1 from explain_assertion('a_global') where classification = 'global'
) as ok;

-- Row-specific assertion: PK equality reduces to row-specific
create table t1 (id integer primary key) using memory;
create assertion a_row check (exists (select 1 from t1 where id = 1));
select prepared_pk_params from explain_assertion('a_row') where classification = 'row' limit 1;
```

## 2.6.2 Mutation Context (Table-Level Parameters)

Quereus supports table-level mutation context variables that provide per-operation parameters for default values and constraints. The primary use case is implementing application-specific security, rights management, and audit mechanisms using signatures, digests, and cryptographic verification.

**Syntax:**
```sql
create table table_name (
  column_definitions...
) using module_name
with context (
  variable_name data_type [null],
  ...
)
```

**DML Syntax:**
```sql
insert into table_name [(columns...)]
with context variable = expression, ...
values (...) | select_statement

update table_name
with context variable = expression, ...
set column = value ...

delete from table_name
with context variable = expression, ...
where condition
```

**Key Features:**
- Context variables are declared in the table definition alongside columns
- Variables default to NOT NULL unless explicitly marked NULL (the session `default_column_nullability` decides, exactly as it does for columns)
- Both unqualified (`varName`) and qualified (`context.varName`) references supported
- Context variables can be used in DEFAULT expressions and CHECK constraints
- Context values are evaluated once per statement, not per row
- Context is captured for deferred constraints and evaluated at COMMIT time

**Which variables a statement must supply:**

The rule is per variable, and it is enforced where the variable is *read*:

- A **NOT NULL** variable must be supplied by any statement whose defaults or constraints read it. One that is read but not supplied fails at plan time with `table '<schema>.<table>' requires mutation context variable '<name>'; supply it with `with context <name> = …``. This is the same diagnosis whether the statement omitted the whole `with context` clause or just that one variable.
- A variable declared **NULL** may be omitted; it reads as NULL. A CHECK comparing against a NULL context variable is *unknown* and therefore passes, like any NULL comparison — write `coalesce(<comparison>, 0)` if the intent is to reject the omission.
- A variable that **no default or constraint of this statement reads** never needs supplying, even when it is NOT NULL. A table may declare a variable only its `check on update` reads, and a DELETE against that table needs no envelope.
- A supplied name the table does **not** declare is ignored, not rejected. A write through a view forwards one envelope to every underlying base table, and each takes only the variables it declares. (This does mean a mistyped variable name reads as NULL rather than being reported, and that a planning error inside an unread assignment's expression goes unreported — the expression is never built.)
- Names are matched **case-insensitively**, like every other identifier: `with context ownerkey = …` supplies a variable declared `OwnerKey`.
- Supplying the same name **twice** is rejected (`mutation context variable '<name>' supplied more than once`), matching the duplicate rules on an INSERT column list and an UPDATE `set` list.
- A context value expression is evaluated to *build* the context row, so it cannot read a context variable — `with context cap = base` reports `base` as an unresolved column even when `base` is itself declared.
- A **maintained table** may not declare mutation context variables at all — `create table … maintained as … with context (…)` and `alter table … set maintained as …` over a table that already declares one both raise an error naming the table and the declared variable(s) (the CREATE arm is sited at the table name; the ALTER arm, raised from the runtime path, carries no location). A maintained table's rows are derived by the engine, never written by a user statement, so no statement could ever supply a value; the declaration is unsatisfiable regardless of whether any DEFAULT or CHECK reads it.

Because context variables shadow same-named columns, a table that declares a variable named like one of its columns resolves a *bare* reference in a DEFAULT or CHECK to the variable — including when the statement supplies no envelope, in which case an omitted NULL-marked variable reads NULL. The `new.<column>` / `old.<column>` forms always reach the column.

**Examples:**

**Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:**
```sql
-- Enforce tenant isolation at database level
create table tenant_records (
  id integer primary key,
  tenant_id text,
  data text,
  constraint tenant_check check (new.tenant_id = context.current_tenant_id)
) using memory
with context (
  current_tenant_id text
);

-- Insert restricted to current tenant
insert into tenant_records (id, tenant_id, data)
with context current_tenant_id = 'tenant_abc'
values (1, 'tenant_abc', 'Private data');  -- Passes

-- Attempt to insert for different tenant fails
insert into tenant_records (id, tenant_id, data)
with context current_tenant_id = 'tenant_abc'
values (2, 'tenant_xyz', 'Data');  -- Fails: tenant mismatch
```

**Audit Trail with Actor Tracking:**
```sql
-- Audit log with actor identity
create table audit_log (
  id integer primary key,
  action text,
  user_id text default actor_id,
  timestamp text default datetime('now')
) using memory
with context (
  actor_id text
);

-- Log action with actor identity
insert into audit_log (id, action)
with context actor_id = 'user123'
values (1, 'DELETE_RECORD');
```

**Permission Verification:**
```sql
-- Prevent unauthorized modifications
create table user_profiles (
  user_id integer primary key,
  email text,
  constraint update_auth check (
    context.requester_id = old.user_id or context.is_admin = 1
  )
) using memory
with context (
  requester_id integer,
  is_admin integer
);

-- User can update their own profile
update user_profiles
with context requester_id = 42, is_admin = 0
set email = 'newemail@example.com'
where user_id = 42;  -- Passes: requester_id matches
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use mutation context for application-specific security and access control
- Implement signature verification, digest validation, and rights checking in constraints
- Store actor identity, timestamps, and cryptographic proofs in defaults
- Use qualified `context.varName` for clarity when variable names might conflict
- Mark optional context variables as NULL — those may then be omitted by a statement and read as NULL
- Combine with user-defined functions for custom verification logic
- A NOT NULL context variable must be supplied by any statement whose defaults or constraints read it

## 2.6.3 Metadata Tags

Quereus supports arbitrary key-value metadata tags on schema objects via `WITH TAGS`. Tags are informational only -- the engine does not derive behavior from them. They do not affect schema hashing.

**Syntax:**
```sql
-- Table-level tags
create table Orders (
  id integer primary key,
  name text not null
) with tags (display_name = 'Customer Orders', audit = true);

-- Column-level tags
create table Products (
  id integer primary key with tags (display_name = 'Product ID'),
  name text not null with tags (searchable = true)
);

-- Constraint-level tags
create table Employees (
  id integer primary key,
  email text not null,
  constraint uq_email unique (email) with tags (error_message = 'Email must be unique')
);

-- View and index tags
create view ActiveUsers as select * from Users where active = 1
  with tags (cacheable = true);

create index idx_name on Products (name) with tags (purpose = 'search optimization');
```

Tag values can be strings, numbers, booleans (`true`/`false`), or `null`. Tag keys are identifiers. `TAGS` is a contextual keyword and can still be used as a regular identifier. `WITH TAGS` can appear alongside `WITH CONTEXT` in any order.

Tags are available on the schema interfaces (`TableSchema.tags`, `ColumnSchema.tags`, etc.) and via the programmatic API (`SchemaManager.getTableTags()`, `SchemaManager.setTableTags()`, `SchemaManager.setColumnTags()`, `SchemaManager.setConstraintTags()`). Tags set at `CREATE` time can be changed later from SQL with `ALTER TABLE … SET TAGS` (whole-set replacement; see [§2.7](#27-alter-table-statement)).

A tag edit raises **no schema-change event** on `db.onSchemaChange` — not for `SET`, `ADD`, or `DROP TAGS`, and not at the table, column, or named-constraint site. Tags are informational and catalog-only, so no backend announces them; see [`usage.md`](usage.md#what-each-alter-table-arm-reports) § What each `ALTER TABLE` arm reports. An application that must react to tag edits has to poll the schema interfaces above.

**Reserved namespace `quereus.*`:** keys whose name starts with `quereus.` are reserved for the engine and validated against a typed registry (`src/schema/reserved-tags.ts`). The two most common keys, both rename hints, are:

| Key | Used by | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `"quereus.id"` | `apply schema` / `diff schema` | Stable identifier — when a declared and actual object share the same `quereus.id` but have different names, the differ emits a rename instead of a drop+create. Authoritative; wins over `previous_name`. |
| `"quereus.previous_name"` | `apply schema` / `diff schema` | One or more comma-separated old names. The differ matches a declared object whose name is missing in the catalog against an actual object whose name appears in this list. |

This is only a subset; other reserved keys include `quereus.expose_implicit_index` and the `quereus.lens.*` family (see the registry for the full set). An **unrecognized or mis-sited** `quereus.*` key is a **hard error** — rejected loudly at plan-build on every authoring path (`CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX … WITH TAGS`, `ALTER … SET TAGS`, statement-level DML `WITH TAGS` (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`), and `apply schema` / `diff schema`) rather than silently stored — so a typo (`quereus.idd`) or a view-only key on a physical table fails the statement. Note that **no** reserved key is currently legal at the DML-statement site — the namespace there is purely a typo guard (since the `quereus.update.*` retirement, every `quereus.*` key on a DML statement is rejected, whether the statement targets a base table or a view). Tag keys with dots must use the quoted-identifier form (`"quereus.id"`). Non-reserved (free-form) keys outside the `quereus.*` namespace are accepted untouched.

Example — declaring a renamed table and column:

```sql
declare schema main {
  table customer {
    customer_id integer primary key with tags ("quereus.previous_name" = 'client_id'),
    full_name text not null with tags ("quereus.previous_name" = 'name')
  } with tags (
    "quereus.id" = 'tbl-customer',
    "quereus.previous_name" = 'client'
  )
}
```

Against an existing `client(client_id, name)`, this diffs to `ALTER TABLE client RENAME TO customer` plus two `ALTER TABLE customer RENAME COLUMN ...` rather than dropping and recreating.

## 2.7 ALTER TABLE Statement

Moved to [SQL Schema Modification — ALTER](sql-alter.md#27-alter-table-statement), with the
tag verbs on views, materialized views, and indexes.
