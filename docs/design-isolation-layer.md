# Isolation Layer Design

## Overview

This document describes a **generic transaction isolation layer** that can wrap any `VirtualTableModule` to provide ACID transaction semantics with read-your-own-writes and savepoint support. It does **not** provide snapshot isolation or write-write conflict detection — see [Isolation Level Provided](#isolation-level-provided) below.

The goal is to decouple **storage** concerns from **isolation** concerns:

- **Storage modules** (memory, LevelDB, IndexedDB, custom) focus on persistence and indexing
- **Isolation layer** provides consistent transaction semantics across all modules

This enables module authors to implement simple read/write logic while getting full transaction support "for free."

| [Isolation Layer — Challenges and Mitigations](design-isolation-challenges.md) | The six hard problems this design has to solve, and what the layer does about each: merge iteration, cursor validity during mutation, commit failure recovery, per-read overlay overhead, large-transaction storage, and DDL against a table other connections hold overlays on (including the overlay poison rules). |

---

## Motivation

### Current State

The memory virtual table module (`@quereus/quereus`) implements its own transaction isolation using `inheritree` B+Trees with copy-on-write inheritance. This works well but:

1. The isolation logic is tightly coupled to the storage implementation
2. Other modules (store, sync, custom) must re-implement isolation from scratch
3. Each implementation has different semantics and edge cases

The store modules (`quereus-store`) currently have no read isolation—queries see committed data only, not pending writes from the current transaction.

### Desired State

A composable isolation layer that:

- Wraps any underlying module transparently
- Provides read-your-own-writes isolation semantics (not a stable snapshot — see below)
- Handles savepoints via nested layers
- Is well-tested in one place rather than per-module

### Key Principle: Row-Level Composition

The isolation layer operates purely at the **row level**, merging query results from two modules:

1. **Overlay module** — Stores uncommitted changes (inserts, updates, deletes as tombstones)
2. **Underlying module** — Stores committed data

Both modules are accessed through the standard `VirtualTable` and `VirtualTableConnection` interfaces. The isolation layer has no knowledge of BTrees, blocks, LevelDB, or any implementation details.

### Why Use a Module as Overlay Storage?

Using an existing module for overlay storage provides:

- **Range scan support** — The overlay module already implements efficient range iteration
- **Secondary index support** — The overlay module maintains its own indexes
- **Savepoint support** — The overlay module's transaction semantics handle savepoints
- **Consistency** — Same query semantics for overlay and underlying data

The isolation layer's only job is merging two row streams.

### Overlay Module Selection

The overlay module is configurable and can be any module that supports isolation:

| Overlay Module | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|
| Memory vtab | Default; fast, ephemeral, suitable for most transactions |
| LevelDB/IndexedDB | Large transactions, crash recovery of uncommitted work |
| Same as underlying | Uniform storage, useful for testing |

The key requirement is that the overlay module must support the capabilities needed for isolation (particularly savepoints if the isolation layer exposes savepoint support).

### Per-Connection Overlay Architecture

The isolation layer uses a **per-connection overlay** architecture:

```
IsolationModule
├── underlyingTables: Map<"schema.table", UnderlyingTableState>
│   └── underlyingTable (shared across all connections)
│
└── connectionOverlays: Map<"dbId:schema.table", ConnectionOverlayState>
    ├── Connection 1: overlayTable, hasChanges
    ├── Connection 2: overlayTable, hasChanges
    └── ...
```

**Key properties:**

1. **Underlying tables are shared** — All connections read from the same committed data
2. **Overlays are per-connection** — Each database instance gets its own overlay per table
3. **Overlays are created lazily** — No memory overhead until first write in a transaction
4. **Schema is discovered lazily** — Supports modules that load schema from persistent storage

This architecture ensures:
- Read-your-own-writes: A connection sees its own uncommitted changes
- Isolation: Other connections don't see uncommitted changes
- Efficiency: No overlay created for read-only transactions

#### Table identity: the connect-time name is authoritative

Both maps above are keyed on the same `(schemaName, tableName)` pair, and the commit flush
(`commitConnectionOverlays`) crosses between them: it strips the `dbId:` prefix from an overlay
key and looks the remainder up in `underlyingTables`. If the two maps ever key the same table
differently, that lookup misses and the staged rows are dropped — while the commit still reports
success.

The single identity for a table is therefore the `(schemaName, tableName)` pair passed to
`IsolationModule.create()` / `.connect()`, threaded into `IsolatedTable`'s constructor and used
for every keyed lookup it performs (overlay, pre-overlay savepoints, in-flight build coalescing,
the registered connection's qualified name).

`IsolatedTable` must **never** take its identity from `underlyingTable.schemaName` /
`.tableName`. `VirtualTable.tableName` is contracted bare (see `packages/quereus/src/vtab/table.ts`),
but an underlying module may violate that and report a schema-qualified name — `lamina-quereus`
does, using the field as a catalogue lookup key. Keying off the connect-time pair makes the two
maps agree by construction, whatever the underlying self-reports.

The same reasoning rules out keying off `underlyingTable.tableSchema` — that field is documented
as possibly populated lazily by the underlying module, so it may be absent at construction time.

#### Invariant: every staged overlay resolves to an underlying table at commit

Keying the two maps consistently is necessary but not sufficient — the entries must also both
still *exist* when `commitConnectionOverlays` crosses between them. The table-lifecycle hooks are
what keep that true, and each has to do explicit work:

- **`destroy()` (DROP TABLE)** removes the `underlyingTables` entry, so it also resolves the
  `connectionOverlays` and `preOverlaySavepoints` entries for that table across **every** db id.
  DROP TABLE is not transaction-scoped: the table is gone for all connections, so no overlay
  against it can ever be flushed. Who gets told differs by overlay. The **dropping connection's
  own** overlay is discarded silently (it issued the DROP). A **foreign** overlay with staged rows
  is **poisoned** and kept — sweeping it let that connection commit against an empty overlay set
  and report success after its rows were discarded, which is silent cross-connection data loss. A
  **foreign** overlay with no staged rows is discarded; nothing is lost. `preOverlaySavepoints` is
  swept for every key whose overlay did not survive (without this the single-table case leaked the
  overlay and its savepoint set for the lifetime of the `Database`); a surviving poisoned overlay
  keeps its set, which its owner's rollback reaps. See
  [*ALTER / DROP overlay poison*](design-isolation-challenges.md#alter--drop-overlay-poison).
- **`renameTable()` (ALTER TABLE … RENAME TO)** evicts the cached underlying handle for the old
  name (the underlying module may have closed it — `StoreModule` closes and re-opens stores during
  a rename) and re-keys any staged overlay onto the new name. It must therefore **re-connect** a
  fresh underlying under the new name whenever it carried an overlay across, using the vtab module
  name and args from the pre-rename catalog entry (the hook's signature carries neither, and the
  engine updates the catalog only *after* the hook returns). With no overlay carried across there
  is nothing to flush, so the eviction alone suffices and the next `connect()` re-resolves lazily.
  It deliberately does **not** re-key `preOverlaySavepoints`: that set is maintained and cleared by
  the callbacks of the `IsolatedTable` the registered `IsolatedConnection` was built from, and that
  instance keeps the pre-rename name for the rest of the transaction. Moving the set would leave the
  old-name instance clearing a key nobody owns while the moved set leaked into the next transaction,
  where a matching `rollback to savepoint` depth would wrongly discard that transaction's overlay.
  The first statement after the rename registers a new connection under the new name and
  `Database.registerConnection` replays the active savepoint stack onto it, so nothing is lost.

A staged overlay (`hasChanges === true`) that still fails to resolve at commit is a violation of
this invariant, and `commitConnectionOverlays` raises `StatusCode.INTERNAL`. It never silently
drops the rows: doing so reported a *successful* commit that persisted nothing, and — because the
skipped overlay also never reached the clear-loop — left a zombie overlay that kept merging into
every later read on that `Database`, so the connection that lost the data was the last to notice.
A **clean** overlay (`hasChanges === false`) that fails to resolve staged nothing, so it is simply
discarded.

The invariant has a second dependency that lives outside this layer: **the wrapper's registered
`IsolatedConnection` must survive the underlying module's rename.** `Database` commits by calling
`commit()` on every registered connection — the loop is name-agnostic — so that connection is the
only thing that ever drives `commitConnectionOverlays`. An underlying module that evicts *every*
connection registered under the old table name (rather than only the ones it created itself)
therefore deletes the sole path from the staged overlay to storage, and the commit reports success
having written nothing. `StoreModule.renameTable` therefore evicts on class identity (`instanceof
StoreConnection`) *and* an exact qualified-name match, never on the name alone. See **Evicting
connections on `renameTable`** in [`module-authoring.md`](module-authoring.md) — the same rule binds
any module that means to be wrappable.

#### Mid-transaction rename on a store-backed table is a partial commit

`StoreModule.renameTable` DDL-commits its module-wide `TransactionCoordinator` — every table's
pending ops, not only the renamed table's — before it relocates the physical stores, because a
directory move cannot be rolled back through the coordinator. So an `alter table … rename to`
issued inside a transaction against a store-backed table *is*, by construction, a partial commit
of the store module's pending writes. The isolation layer does not change that; it only ensures
its own staged rows are flushed in the same batch instead of being dropped.

The asymmetry that follows is inherited from those store rename semantics, not introduced by the
isolation layer: a `rollback` after a mid-transaction rename still discards the overlay
(`IsolatedConnection.rollback` → `onConnectionRollback`), even though the store's own pre-rename
ops were already DDL-committed and cannot come back.

## Isolation Level Provided

It's worth being precise about what level of isolation this layer actually delivers,
since "MVCC-style" and "isolation layer" can suggest snapshot isolation. It does not
provide that. The actual guarantee is **read-committed reads plus read-your-own-writes**:

- **Read-your-own-writes** — a connection always sees its own uncommitted overlay
  changes (inserts/updates/deletes it has staged but not yet committed).
- **Reads of shared state are live, not a snapshot** — the merged read path
  (`IsolatedTable.query`) merges the overlay against the *live* underlying table on
  every read, and the underlying table is shared across all connections. If another
  connection commits between two reads in this transaction, the second read can
  observe that commit. There is no point-in-time view captured at `BEGIN`.
- **No write-write conflict detection** — this layer does not detect when two
  connections write the same row in overlapping transactions. At commit, each
  connection's overlay is flushed to the underlying independently
  (`flushOverlayToUnderlying`); whichever connection flushes last wins, silently
  overwriting the other's write.
- **Snapshotting, if needed, is the underlying module's job** — a module wrapped by
  this layer (the `underlying` module) is free to provide its own stable-snapshot
  reads; the isolation layer neither provides nor blocks that. If a consumer needs
  guaranteed snapshot isolation on top of a non-snapshotting underlying module, the
  intended extension point is an optional snapshotting pass-through module inserted
  *below* the isolation layer — no such module exists today.

This is intentional scope, not a gap to be closed here: this layer's job is
read-your-own-writes plus savepoints on top of an arbitrary underlying module: not
cross-connection consistency, which is a storage-layer concern.

## Core Concepts

### Overlay Storage

The overlay is a virtual table instance (typically from the memory vtab module) that stores uncommitted changes for a connection. It mirrors the schema of the underlying table, including:

- Primary key columns
- All data columns
- Secondary indexes

The overlay table has an additional hidden column or marker to distinguish tombstones (deleted rows) from regular rows.

### Change Types

The overlay stores three types of changes as rows:

1. **Insert** — New row not present in underlying module (stored as regular row)
2. **Update** — Modified row replacing one in underlying module (stored as regular row)
3. **Delete** — Tombstone marking a row as removed (stored with tombstone marker)

The isolation layer doesn't distinguish inserts from updates—both are simply "this PK should return this row." The distinction only matters at commit time when applying to the underlying module.

### Merge Semantics

When reading, the isolation layer merges overlay changes with underlying data:

```
For each row from underlying module:
  - If overlay has tombstone for this PK → skip row
  - If overlay has update for this PK → emit overlay row instead
  - Otherwise → emit underlying row

For each insert in overlay not yet emitted:
  - Emit at correct sort position
```

This is analogous to LSM-tree merge or 3-way merge in version control.

---

## Transaction Lifecycle

### Begin Transaction

1. Create new `OverlayState` for this connection (or inherit from existing if nested)
2. Call `underlyingConnection.begin()` to start underlying transaction

### Read Operations

1. Execute query against overlay first
2. Execute same query against underlying module
3. Merge results using primary key ordering
4. For secondary-index scans: one full scan of the overlay collects both the set of PKs the
   overlay modified (tombstones included, so the underlying's shadowed rows drop from the
   merge) and the overlay's live rows. The isolation layer itself re-applies the query's
   pushed constraints to those rows and sorts them by the scan's (indexKey, PK) key before
   merging — the overlay is never asked to resolve the scan's index name, because an
   underlying module may drive the scan under an index it minted per plan (e.g. lamina's
   `_compound_v_0`), a name no table schema (and therefore no overlay) declares

#### Committed-snapshot reads get their own underlying handle

A `committed.<table>` read (the engine's concurrent committed-read path, which connects with
`_readCommitted: true`) bypasses the overlay entirely — `IsolatedTable.query` delegates
straight to the underlying. That handle is **not** the memoized writer handle:
`IsolationModule.connect` routes a `_readCommitted` connect to a dedicated
`underlying.connect(...)` and never reads or writes `underlyingTables` on that path.

Sharing the writer handle would tear the read. `commitConnectionOverlays` flushes staged rows
through it incrementally — Phase 1 begins the underlying and applies row by row, Phase 2
commits — so a read landing between the phases observes a half-applied batch, defeating the
underlying's own atomic commit one level up.

The dedicated handle is deliberately **not memoized** either. A `_readCommitted` memory table
pins its read layer at the first scan pull and serves that layer for the life of the instance,
so a handle cached for the table's lifetime would serve the same committed state forever and
hold the layer chain against collapse. Not memoizing also keeps `destroy` / `renameTable` / the
attach seams free of a second eviction.

`IsolatedTable.disconnect()` releases the handle it opened (and only that one). This is
required, not tidy: on the memory path `disconnect` is what drops the pinned read layer's
collapse protection. `IsolatedTable.createConnection()` throws on a committed instance — a
`_readCommitted` connection must not join the writer's transaction.

Consequently `IsolationModule.readCommittedSnapshot` **mirrors the underlying** rather than
declining unconditionally: the wrapper adds no tearing window of its own, but it cannot promise
more than the underlying delivers (an underlying that ignores `_readCommitted` — the store
stack — hands back a handle indistinguishable from the writer's).

### Write Operations

1. Apply change to overlay only (insert/update/delete)
2. Update overlay's primary index
3. Update overlay's secondary indexes
4. Do NOT write to underlying module yet

### Savepoint

1. Call `overlayConnection.savepoint(n)` to create savepoint in overlay module
2. The overlay module handles the savepoint semantics internally

### Rollback to Savepoint

1. Call `overlayConnection.rollbackToSavepoint(n)` to revert overlay changes
2. The overlay module discards changes made after the savepoint

### Commit

The database drives commit as a **sequential loop over registered connections**, and the
isolation layer registers **one covering connection per table**. So a transaction that wrote
to *N* tables has *N* connections in that loop. To keep a multi-table commit atomic, the flush
does **not** run per connection; instead the **first** connection's commit drives one
transaction-wide, two-phase flush across **every** overlay the db-transaction staged
(`IsolationModule.commitConnectionOverlays`), and clears them all — so the remaining
connections in the loop find their overlay already gone and no-op. (Earlier, each connection
flushed *and committed* its own underlying table independently; table A's underlying commit
landed durably before table B had even applied, so a failure in B left A committed — a torn
transaction. The two-phase flush below is the fix.)

**Phase 1 — apply all (no commit).** For every staged overlay, `begin()` its underlying table
and apply the overlay's rows via `update()` calls, **tombstones (deletes) first, then
inserts/updates**, but do **not** commit. The delete-before-insert ordering matters when one
commit both writes a row and evicts a different row on a shared secondary UNIQUE (e.g. an
`INSERT OR REPLACE` that replaces a PK-colliding row *and* evicts a UNIQUE-colliding row at
another PK): the delete must free the constrained value before the colliding write, or the
underlying rejects it on a UNIQUE conflict. Each PK appears at most once in the overlay, so
reordering across PKs never inverts a same-PK delete/insert pair. The insert/update flushes
are issued as **trusted writes** (`trustedWrite: true`): the underlying module skips its own
per-write PK/UNIQUE re-enforcement and just persists the already-validated final state. This
is required because a value-swap cycle (e.g. two rows exchanging a UNIQUE value within one txn)
has no conflict-free row-by-row apply order — an intermediate row would transiently duplicate a
UNIQUE value and a naive per-write check would wrongly reject it. The merged-view pre-checks are
therefore the sole authority for the final committed state; secondary-index maintenance still
runs incrementally per write, and a transient duplicate index value is harmless because index
keys are suffixed with the PK. Any `constraint` result returned by an underlying `update()` here
is a violated invariant (the merged-view pre-checks should have resolved it before commit) and
is thrown as an INTERNAL error rather than silently swallowed.

**Phase-1 invariant — the flush must not read an underlying table once it has begun writing
that table.** Deciding insert-vs-update for a live overlay row is a read: a full-PK point lookup
that drives the underlying's primary index (`rowExistsInUnderlying`). Every one of those probes
is therefore resolved **up front**, before the first `update()` of that table's flush lands. An
underlying module is under no obligation to serve reads — least of all index-driven ones — over
its own uncommitted writes: a module that only authors its compound/secondary index entries when
the write batch resolves must *refuse* an index walk over staged state rather than answer from a
silently stale index (lamina's staged collection does exactly this). Probing inline in the write
loop consequently failed every probe after the first, breaking any transaction that wrote two or
more rows to one table with a compound primary key. Hoisting the probes is answer-preserving
because each PK appears at most once in the overlay, so no write in the flush can change another
entry's existence answer — and it costs one fewer read per written row. The invariant is
per table, not per commit: Phase 1 may legitimately probe table B after writing table A.

**Phase 2 — commit all.** Once **every** overlay has applied, `commit()` the affected
underlying tables. For a `quereus-store` underlying (whose tables share one module-wide
`TransactionCoordinator`) Phase 1's begins/applies all accumulate in that single coordinator,
so the first `commit()` flushes **every** table's ops in one atomic coordinator commit — a
single `AtomicBatch.write()` on a provider that exposes `beginAtomicBatch` (IndexedDB, LevelDB)
— and the remaining commits no-op. For an underlying with per-table transaction domains (the
default memory vtab) each table commits independently.

**On any Phase-1 error:** roll back every underlying begun so far and rethrow. Nothing was
committed, so the transaction aborts atomically.

Finally, clear all overlay state (and, per connection, its pre-overlay savepoint set).

### Rollback

1. Discard overlay state entirely
2. Call `underlyingConnection.rollback()`

---

## Capability Discovery

Modules should advertise their isolation support so consumers can make informed decisions.

### Capability Interface

```typescript
interface ModuleCapabilities {
  /** Module provides transaction isolation (read-your-own-writes; not necessarily snapshot reads — see the module's own docs for the actual isolation level) */
  isolation?: boolean;

  /** Module supports savepoints within transactions */
  savepoints?: boolean;

  /** Module persists data across restarts */
  persistent?: boolean;

  /** Module supports secondary indexes */
  secondaryIndexes?: boolean;

  /** Module supports range scans (not just point lookups) */
  rangeScans?: boolean;

  /**
   * Module owns ADD-COLUMN NOT-NULL-backfill semantics and opts out of the
   * engine-generic rejection of NOT-NULL-without-usable-DEFAULT on non-empty
   * tables (see `vtab/capabilities.ts` for full docs).
   */
  delegatesNotNullBackfill?: boolean;
}

interface VirtualTableModule {
  // ... existing methods

  /** Returns capability flags for this module */
  getCapabilities?(): ModuleCapabilities;
}
```

### Usage

```typescript
const module = db.getModule('store');
const caps = module.getCapabilities?.() ?? {};

if (!caps.isolation) {
  // Wrap with isolation layer, or warn user
  console.warn('Module does not provide isolation; queries may see partial writes');
}
```

### Wrapped Module Capabilities

When the isolation layer wraps a module, it augments the capabilities:

| Capability | Underlying | Wrapped Result |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| `isolation` | `false` | `true` |
| `savepoints` | `false` | `true` |
| `persistent` | (passthrough) | (passthrough) |
| `secondaryIndexes` | (passthrough) | (passthrough) |

## Secondary Index Handling

### Why the Overlay Must Have Matching Indexes

Consider a table with a secondary index on `email`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT UNIQUE);
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```

A query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';
```

Uses the secondary index. If the overlay only tracks by primary key:

1. Query asks underlying module's index for `email = 'alice@example.com'`
2. Underlying returns row with `id = 5`
3. But overlay might have deleted id=5, or updated its email to something else!

The merge handles this by excluding every PK the overlay touched from the underlying's
stream and contributing the overlay's live rows instead (filtered to the query's window and
sorted by the scan's sort key — see *Read Operations* above; the merged read deliberately
never queries the overlay by the scan's index name, which may be a name the underlying
minted per plan). The overlay still copies the underlying's secondary indexes and UNIQUE
constraints so that:
- The overlay's own module natively enforces the table's UNIQUE constraints on staged rows
  (narrowed to live rows, below)
- Mid-transaction index DDL can validate the staged rows and adopt the new structure into an
  already-open overlay, keeping it in the same schema shape as the underlying

### Overlay Table Schema

The isolation layer creates an overlay table with:
- Same columns as underlying table
- Same primary key
- Same secondary indexes and UNIQUE constraints, each narrowed to live rows (below)
- Additional tombstone marker column

This is handled automatically when the isolation layer creates the overlay table instance.

A tombstone carries its row's primary key and `NULL` in every other column, so it is not a
row a UNIQUE structure should ever judge. Every copied secondary index and every copied
UNIQUE constraint therefore gets `<tombstone column> = 0` AND-ed onto whatever partial
predicate it already carried (`createOverlaySchema` in `isolation-module.ts`), scoping it to
live overlay rows only. Without this, a UNIQUE structure whose columns are entirely inside
the primary key would see two tombstones — or a tombstone and a live row — sharing a PK as
colliding duplicates, since tombstones carry real PK values. (A UNIQUE structure over an
ordinary, non-PK column never showed this: a tombstone's value there is `NULL`, and SQL
treats `NULL`s as distinct.) The overlay's own **primary-key** uniqueness is deliberately
*not* narrowed — it must keep covering tombstones so a re-insert at a tombstoned PK is
detected and converted into an overwrite rather than a fresh insert.

### Index Scan Merge

When scanning via secondary index:

1. Full-scan the overlay ONCE. Collect the set of PKs it modified (tombstones included) and,
   for each live (non-tombstone) row, keep it only if it satisfies the query's pushed
   constraints — the isolation layer re-applies that window itself (`buildConstraintMatcher`),
   because the overlay is never asked to resolve the scan's index name. That name may be one
   the underlying minted per plan (e.g. lamina's `_compound_v_0`), which no overlay declares.
   The matcher compares each constrained column the way the *underlying* filters its own
   stream: the index key column's collation normally, but the declared type's `compare` for
   a **semantic-ordering** column (TIMESPAN, JSON — see [types-ordering.md § Semantic
   ordering](types-ordering.md#semantic-ordering)), via `constraintComparator`. That is a correctness
   requirement, not a refinement — the underlying claimed the window's filters *handled*, so
   no residual `Filter` survives above the merge to re-check what this matcher lets through
   or drops, and a plain text compare inverts such a column in both directions (`'PT1M'`
   sorts above `'PT1H'`, `'PT180M'` below it).
2. Sort the kept overlay rows by the scan's `(indexKey…, pk…)` sort key — the full scan emits
   PK order, so the merge cannot rely on the overlay's emission order.
3. Execute the index scan on the underlying table → committed rows in sort-key order.
4. Merge the two sorted streams by sort key:
   - Underlying row whose PK is in the modified set → skip (overlay shadows it)
   - Otherwise interleave overlay and underlying rows by sort key

The set of PKs modified in the overlay (used to exclude shadowed underlying rows)
is keyed with the engine's canonical `serializeRowKey` encoder — one string
normalizer per PK column, drawn from that column's declared collation — **not**
`JSON.stringify`. `JSON.stringify` throws on a bigint PK value and ignores
collation, so under a NOCASE PK a case-only key rewrite (`'abc'` → `'ABC'`) would
fail to shadow the underlying row and surface both. The canonical encoder tags
bigint safely and maps collation-equal keys to identical strings, agreeing with
`getComparePK`/`keysEqual`. The encoder is built by `makePkKeySerializer`
(`overlay-rows.ts`), a thin wrapper over the engine's `makePkIdentitySerializer`
(`@quereus/quereus`, `util/key-serializer.ts`) — the single implementation of "are these
two primary keys the same row?", shared with the sync engine's per-row metadata keying, so
the two layers cannot drift.

Those normalizers resolve through the **owning connection** (`db.getKeyNormalizerResolver()`,
bound in the `IsolatedTable` constructor beside `getCollationResolver()`), never a
process-global built-ins table — otherwise a collation registered or overridden with
`db.registerCollation` would key the overlay row differently from the comparator that
merges it, and the staged row would again fail to shadow the base row. As a consequence, a
text PK column under a collation registered **without** a `normalizer` raises `collation
<name> has no key normalizer` on this path rather than silently under-shadowing; primary-key
scans, which need only the comparator, are unaffected. A PK column whose declared type can
never hold text (`n integer collate mycoll`) takes the identity normalizer and never
consults the collation, matching the engine's own hash-key sites.

## Key Ordering

### Which index is being scanned (scan-order source of truth)

Before it can merge, the layer must know the order the underlying scan emits — primary-key
order, or `(secondaryIndexKey…, pk…)` order. It reads that from **`FilterInfo.accessPath`**,
the planner's typed, validated {@link AccessPath} record (`resolveScanIndex` in
`isolated-table.ts`), **not** by pattern-matching the free-text `idxStr` wire string. The map is:

| `accessPath.kind`            | Merge order chosen                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fullScan` / `empty`         | primary key (see the full-scan contract below)                |
| `index`, `role: 'primary'`   | primary key — **regardless of the index's name** (an alias like `_primary_1` still merges by PK) |
| `index`, `role: 'secondary'` | `(indexKey…, pk…)`, using the descriptor's full `keyColumns`   |
| `unresolvedIndex`            | **INTERNAL error** (see below)                                |

This holds **regardless of the plan kind**, not only for a plain unbounded or bounded-range
scan: a `multiSeek` (`plan=5`, e.g. `WHERE pk IN (3, 1, 2)`) on an index with `role:
'primary'` still merges by primary key, so the underlying module owes ascending (or, for a
`DESC` leading key, descending) primary-key emission order for its multi-seek too — not the
order its seek keys were handed to it (seek-argument order, i.e. the order the `IN` list
appears in the SQL text). A multi-seek that visits keys in seek-argument order instead
mis-pairs overlay rows against stale stored rows whenever that order does not already
happen to match key order (fix/bug-isolation-multiseek-merge-order). Both shipped
backends — the in-memory table (`scan-layer.ts`) and the persistent store
(`store-table-scan.ts`) — sort their multi-seek keys under the index's own key comparator
before visiting them for exactly this reason; see `docs/module-authoring.md` for the
contract as stated to third-party module authors.

`role` is authoritative, not `name`. A module that mints a per-plan alias for its primary
key (lamina-quereus appends a counter: `_primary_` → `_primary_1`, `_primary_2`, …) is still
recognised as a PK walk because it returns an `indexDescriptor` with `role: 'primary'`. When
that primary walk reaches the overlay `MemoryTable` — which only knows its PK index by the
canonical name `_primary_` — `adaptFilterInfoForOverlay` retargets the FilterInfo's index name
to `_primary_` via the engine's `retargetFilterInfoIndex`, so the overlay re-plans the same
primary-key scan instead of failing to resolve a non-existent secondary index of the alias name.

**Full-scan merge contract.** A `fullScan` (or provably-`empty`) access path merges by primary
key because every underlying module the isolation layer wraps emits an unbounded scan in
primary-key order. That is a contract the underlying owes, not an inference the layer draws from
any string. The layer's own internal scans (overlay-merge, ALTER/DROP INDEX overlay migrations,
the commit flush, PK point lookups) build their FilterInfo through the engine's
`makeFullScanFilterInfo` / `makeIndexEqSeekFilterInfo` helpers, which always populate
`accessPath`; a hand-built FilterInfo that omits it makes a *dirty-overlay* read throw INTERNAL
(a clean, no-overlay read takes the fast path and never inspects `accessPath`).

**A FilterInfo the module did not negotiate is a seek REQUEST, not a contract — verify before you
believe.** A module owes the constraints in a FilterInfo only when it claimed them through its own
`getBestAccessPlan`; that claim is what earns the engine the right to drop the residual predicate.
Absent it, the answer may be **any superset** of the rows asked for, up to the whole table — a
module that cannot seek the requested columns (the documented, correct behaviour when a column's
logical type orders by meaning rather than by stored bytes, e.g. `TIMESPAN` or `JSON`) simply
scans. Two families of read inside this layer hit that case, and each re-checks the answer itself.

*Hand-built FilterInfo* — the scans above call `VirtualTable.query()` directly, bypassing the
planner, so no negotiation happened at all and no engine sits above the call:

- The three primary-key probes (`getUnderlyingRow`, `getOverlayRow`, the commit flush's
  `rowExistsInUnderlying`) go through `probeRowByPk` in `pk-probe.ts`, which compares each row's
  key to the requested one under the PK's declared collations and semantic-ordering comparators —
  the same `PkEquals` the write path's "same logical key" test uses. The check runs over the
  **whole** iteration, not just row #1: stopping early would turn a false positive ("some row came
  back ⇒ the key is taken") into a false negative that lets a genuine duplicate key through.
- The UNIQUE-conflict search (`findUnderlyingUniqueConflict`) seeks when it can and full-scans
  when it cannot, and re-applies `rowMatchesUniqueConstraint` per returned row either way.

*Someone else's negotiated FilterInfo* — a merged read negotiates with the **underlying** module
and then reads the **overlay**, which claimed nothing. Both merged paths therefore re-apply the
window over the overlay's stream with `buildConstraintMatcher`: `mergedSecondaryIndexQuery` because
it full-scans the overlay outright (it cannot resolve an underlying-minted index name), and
`queryOverlayAsMergeEntries` because a host-supplied scan-only `IsolationConfig.overlay` may answer
the underlying's seek with the whole overlay. Tombstones bypass the matcher deliberately — they
carry null non-PK columns, and an out-of-window tombstone can only shadow a primary key the
underlying stream does not carry.

Correspondingly, `makeIndexEqSeekFilterInfo` reports `aConstraintUsage[].omit: false`. `omit` is
an **output** of `getBestAccessPlan` — the module's own claim that it applied a filter — and a
hand-built FilterInfo cannot assert it on the module's behalf.

**The INTERNAL error a module earns by aliasing without a descriptor.** If a module names an
index anything other than `_primary_` or a real schema index and does **not** return an
`indexDescriptor`, the engine cannot resolve it and records `accessPath.kind:
'unresolvedIndex'` (warning at plan time). The merge then has no way to know the scan's sort
order, so `resolveScanIndex` throws a `QuereusError` (`StatusCode.INTERNAL`) naming the
offending index rather than guessing primary-key order — guessing would silently reorder rows
(the exact corruption this design removes). Fix is on the module: return an `indexDescriptor`
from `getBestAccessPlan` (see `docs/module-authoring.md`). Note this fails loud only on the
merged read path; a committed-snapshot (`readCommitted`) or no-overlay read bypasses the merge.

### The Problem

For merge iteration to work correctly, the overlay must iterate in the **same order** as the underlying module. Different modules may use different orderings:

| Module | Ordering |
|--------|----------|
| Memory vtab | Its layer BTrees' primary-key comparator (`createPrimaryKeyFunctions`): per-column logical type, declared collation, and `DESC` direction |
| Store module | Binary-encoded keys (lexicographic byte order), with the same collation and direction folded into the bytes |

If these differ, merge produces incorrect results.

### Solution: Module-Provided Comparator

The underlying module must provide its key comparison function:

```typescript
interface IsolationCapableTable extends VirtualTable {
  /** Compare two rows by primary key, using module's native ordering */
  comparePrimaryKey(a: SqlValue[], b: SqlValue[]): number;

  /** Extract primary key values from a row */
  extractPrimaryKey(row: Row): SqlValue[];

  /** Compare index keys for a given index */
  compareIndexKey(indexName: string, a: SqlValue[], b: SqlValue[]): number;
}
```

The isolation layer passes these comparators to the overlay module (if configurable) or validates that the overlay and underlying modules use compatible orderings.

`comparePrimaryKey` is optional. When the underlying table does not expose it — every
store-backed table today — `IsolatedTable` falls back to its own comparator, which walks the
PK columns under their declared collations and declared `DESC` directions. Any underlying whose
native key order is not reproducible that way (a custom encoding, a locale-aware byte order)
**must** expose `comparePrimaryKey`.

### Collation Considerations

For text columns with non-binary collation (`NOCASE`, `RTRIM`, or one registered with
`db.registerCollation`):

- The underlying module's comparator must respect the collation
- Collation names resolve against the **owning connection** (`db.getCollationResolver()`, and
  `db.getKeyNormalizerResolver()` for the secondary-index merge's modified-PK set), never
  a process-global registry — an application may replace `NOCASE`/`RTRIM` per database
- The overlay uses the same comparator
- Both iterate in the same order
- A collation named on a **text** PK column must carry a `normalizer` if the table is ever
  scanned through a secondary index inside a transaction with pending writes

The store's *physical key bytes* are a separate matter: they come from an encoder registry that
does not consult the database, so a custom or overridden collation governs comparison but not
key layout. See the `COLLATE` section of `docs/sql.md` for the caveat this places on a store
table's `PRIMARY KEY` collation.

## Cross-Layer Constraint Detection

### Why Resolve at Write Time

UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints span the merged view: a write that does not
collide within the overlay may still collide with an un-tombstoned row in the
underlying table. Deferring detection to flush time would make overwrites silent
and lose the chance to honour `ON CONFLICT IGNORE`/`REPLACE` semantics. Detection
therefore happens in `IsolatedTable.update()` before the overlay write proceeds.

### PK Conflict (`checkMergedPKConflict`)

Called when an INSERT or PK-changing UPDATE produces a new PK with no overlay
entry at that key:

- Underlying has no row at the PK → no conflict.
- Underlying has a row → ABORT returns a constraint result (with `existingRow`
  populated), IGNORE silently no-ops, REPLACE returns null and lets the insert
  proceed (the overlay row will become an UPDATE at flush).

### Non-PK UNIQUE Conflict (`checkMergedUniqueConstraints`)

For each declared non-PK UNIQUE constraint:

- Skip if the new row is null on any constrained column (SQL NULL semantics).
- For partial UNIQUE (`create unique index ... where <predicate>`), skip the
  whole check when the new row's predicate does not unambiguously evaluate to
  TRUE — the row is outside the index's scope and contributes nothing to
  uniqueness. Predicate compilation is memoized per `UniqueConstraintSchema`
  identity via a `WeakMap`, so the hot write path doesn't recompile.
- Search the **merged view** — this connection's overlay superimposed on the
  underlying committed rows — for a row matching on all constrained columns,
  excluding the writer's own PK(s). The merged view splits cleanly along the
  overlay boundary, and each half is searched the way it is cheap to search:

  ```
  merged view  =  (overlay rows)  ∪  (underlying rows with no overlay entry)
  ```

  - **Phase 1 — scan the overlay** (`findOverlayUniqueConflict`). The overlay is
    the transaction's write set: small and already in memory. Skip tombstones and
    the writer's own PK(s); a matching live overlay row IS the merged row (its
    overlay value — not any stale underlying value — is what the merged view holds
    for that PK), so a candidate moved off the value earlier in the same txn no
    longer counts, and one moved *onto* it correctly does.
  - **Phase 2 — seek the underlying** (`findUnderlyingUniqueConflict`). Look up
    underlying rows matching the constrained columns, skipping the writer's own
    PK(s) **and** any PK the overlay already owns (Phase 1's territory, whatever
    the underlying still says). The lookup is an **index seek** when
    `canSeekForConstraint` allows it (below), else the pre-existing full scan;
    either way the per-column match still runs, so a module that ignores the index
    hint and returns extra rows stays correct. `getOverlayRow` now fires only for
    the candidates the seek returned, not once per underlying row.

  Both phases run the same matcher (`rowMatchesUniqueConstraint`) so they compare
  identically, and — for a partial UNIQUE — evaluate the predicate against the
  merged row. Together they cover the merged view exactly once with no row visited
  twice. Phase 1 runs first, so when the constraint was *already* violated an
  overlay-side conflict is reported in preference to an underlying one; under a
  satisfied constraint at most one conflicting row exists, so this tie-break only
  changes *which* row is named in that pre-violated case.
- ABORT returns the constraint result; IGNORE no-ops; REPLACE writes a
  tombstone for the conflicting PK so the row is evicted at flush, then continues.
  The evicted row is surfaced in the same user-facing schema shape whether it came
  from Phase 1 (an overlay row) or Phase 2 (an underlying row).

**When Phase 2 may seek (`canSeekForConstraint`).** Only when the constraint was
synthesized from a `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` (`derivedFromIndex` names a live entry in
`tableSchema.indexes`) AND every key column's index bytes are keyed under the collation
this check *enforces* under. A table-level `unique(a, b)` falls back to the full scan
because it has no index in the engine-facing schema at all — the store's `_uc_*` is
enforcement-only and invisible here, so there is nothing to name in a seek.

The collation half is what makes the seek sound rather than merely fast: the seek
*replaces* the full scan, so a window narrower than the enforcement-equal set silently
loses a UNIQUE violation. It demanded BINARY outright while the store keyed every index
column under the table-wide key collation `K` and ignored the connection's collation
registry — seeking a `NOCASE` index for `'B@X'` physically missed a committed `'b@x'`.
Index key bytes now resolve their normalizers through the connection's registry and
encode under the index column's own effective collation (`docs/store.md` § Collation
Support), which for an index-derived UNIQUE *is* the enforcement collation. So the gate
now asks, per constrained column:

- never-text (`integer`, `real`, `blob`) → seekable; key bytes are type-native.
- enforcement collation BINARY → seekable; BINARY equality is byte identity.
- otherwise seekable only when a key-encoding backend keys the column under that same
  collation — `pkKeyCollationName`'s answer. A collation-aware column (`text`, `any` —
  `compare` honors the handed collation) does (seekable); a collation-blind text-capable
  column (`json`, the temporal types) keys hard-`BINARY` while the check still compares
  under the declared name, so it is **not** seekable and keeps full-scanning.

Equality is all the seek needs — order preservation is a range concern and no range is
built here (`makeSecondaryIndexEqSeekFilter` emits one EQ per key column), so a custom
equality-only collation is fine.

**Every overlay write arm runs this check before writing the overlay.** The
overlay's own memory module sees only overlay rows, and the commit flush writes
the underlying with `trustedWrite` (the underlying skips its own UNIQUE
re-check), so an arm that skipped the merged check would let a collision with a
committed row reach the flush — an opaque INTERNAL error at commit, a duplicate
stored, or (under a UNIQUE `on conflict ignore`) the staged row silently dropped
by the underlying. The arms are: a plain INSERT; an INSERT reviving a PK
tombstoned earlier in the transaction; a PK-REPLACE INSERT over a live overlay
row; a PK-changing UPDATE (of an overlay or an underlying row); a same-PK UPDATE
of an underlying-only row; and a same-PK UPDATE of a row already live in the
overlay. That last arm is gated on `uniqueColumnsChanged` (the engine's shared
same-PK UPDATE gate — memory and store use the same function): it runs only when
a UNIQUE column, or a column a partial UNIQUE's predicate references, changed,
because the check scans the whole overlay per constraint and an ungated bulk
UPDATE of a non-UNIQUE column over N staged rows would cost O(N²). A target that
is a tombstone is never gated: the write revives it, and the stale values a
deleted overlay row keeps may since have been claimed by another row.

The check always receives the **statement's** OR clause, so each constraint
resolves statement OR > its own `on conflict` default > ABORT. It never receives
the PK-folded action `update()` hands the overlay write (`args.onConflict ??`
the PK's default): that action is for the PK alone, and passing it would let a
`primary key on conflict replace` silently delete a row colliding on a plain
UNIQUE. Once the merged check has passed or REPLACE-tombstoned every live
conflict, the PK-folded action the overlay sees is inert for secondary UNIQUEs.

### Tombstones for Evicted Rows

`insertTombstoneForPK` writes a row with PK columns populated and all other
columns (including the constrained UNIQUE columns) set to NULL, plus the
tombstone marker. The null UNIQUE columns ensure the tombstone itself never
matches a future merged-view UNIQUE check, and the underlying scan skips any
PK that has a tombstone in the overlay.

### Trade-offs

- Non-PK UNIQUE checks over an index-derived constraint seek the backing index
  (O(log n) + overlay scan) rather than scanning the underlying, collated or not; a
  table-level `unique(...)` with no backing index, or one over a collation-blind
  (`json` / temporal) column enforced under a non-BINARY collation, still does the
  O(n) full scan (see `canSeekForConstraint`). The overlay's own
  UNIQUE enforcement covers overlay-only conflicts; the merged-view search fills the
  underlying-only gap. Phase 1 always scans the (small) overlay in full.
- Same-PK REPLACE returns null instead of carrying the replaced row back to
  the DML executor, so FK CASCADE side-effects do not fire for replacements
  resolved through the isolation layer (tracked separately).

## Relationship to Memory VTab

### Current Memory VTab Architecture

The memory vtab uses `inheritree` BTrees for both storage and isolation in a tightly integrated design:

- Base data stored in BTrees
- Transaction layers created via BTree copy-on-write inheritance
- Efficient single-layer design, but couples storage and isolation

### Future Options

**Option A: Keep Memory VTab Special**

Memory vtab continues using integrated approach for performance. Isolation layer used only for store and custom modules.

- Pros: No performance regression for memory vtab
- Cons: Two isolation implementations to maintain

**Option B: Unify Under Isolation Layer**

Create a "raw memory module" (BTrees, no isolation) and wrap with isolation layer.

- Pros: Single isolation implementation, simpler memory vtab
- Cons: Some performance overhead, two layers of BTrees

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A. Measure performance of Option B. Migrate if overhead is acceptable.

## API Surface

### Wrapping a Module

```typescript
import { IsolationModule } from '@quereus/isolation';
import { StoreModule } from '@quereus/store';
import { MemoryModule } from '@quereus/quereus';

// Create underlying module (the persistent storage)
const storeModule = new StoreModule(leveldb);

// Create overlay module (for uncommitted changes)
const overlayModule = new MemoryModule();  // Or another StoreModule, etc.

// Wrap with isolation
const isolatedModule = new IsolationModule({
  underlying: storeModule,
  overlay: overlayModule,
});

// Register with database
db.registerModule('store', isolatedModule);
```

### Checking Capabilities

```typescript
const caps = isolatedModule.getCapabilities();
// { isolation: true, savepoints: true, persistent: true, ... }
```

### Transparent Usage

Once wrapped, usage is identical to any other module:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE users USING store (...);
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice');
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns Alice (read-your-own-write)
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns nothing
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `OverlayState`: insert, update, delete, iteration, savepoints
- `MergeIterator`: all combinations of overlay/underlying states
- Secondary index tracking: insert, update, delete propagation

### Property-Based Tests

Using fast-check or similar:

- Generate random sequences of operations
- Apply to isolated module and a reference implementation
- Verify results match

### Integration Tests

- Wrap memory vtab with isolation layer, run existing memory vtab tests
- Wrap store module with isolation layer, verify read-your-own-writes
- Multi-table transactions with mixed modules
