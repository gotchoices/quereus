# Window Function Implementation in Quereus

> **Stability: Stable** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

This document describes the architecture and implementation of SQL window functions in Quereus's Titan runtime system.

## Overview

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single result (unlike aggregate functions in GROUP BY). Quereus provides comprehensive window function support with a modern, extensible architecture that follows the Titan principles of immutable PlanNodes and instruction-based runtime execution.

**Supported window functions:**
- **Ranking Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `PERCENT_RANK()`, `CUME_DIST()`
- **Navigation Functions**: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`
- **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` with OVER clause

## Architecture Components

### Parser Layer (`src/parser/parser.ts`)

The parser handles full SQL standard window function syntax:

```sql
window_function([arguments]) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...]]
  [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | LAST] [, ...]]
  [frame_clause]
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Parses `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses
- Supports `NULLS FIRST/LAST` in ORDER BY
- Handles frame specifications: `ROWS BETWEEN ... AND ...`
- Creates `WindowFunctionExpr` AST nodes

### Planner Layer

**WindowNode (`src/planner/nodes/window-node.ts`):**
- Groups window functions with identical window specifications for efficiency
- Converts AST expressions to `ScalarPlanNode` objects for proper attribute resolution
- Maintains separate collections for partition expressions, ORDER BY expressions, and function arguments

**Query Building (`src/planner/building/select.ts`):**
- Identifies window functions in SELECT lists
- Groups functions by window specification to minimize processing
- Converts expressions to plan nodes for deterministic execution

### Runtime Layer (`src/runtime/emit/window.ts`)

Complete implementation following Titan architecture principles:

**Key Features:**
- **Attribute-based context resolution** - No hard-coded column mappings
- **Proper expression evaluation** - Uses callbacks for all expressions
- **Frame-aware execution** - Implements correct windowing semantics
- **SQL-compliant sorting** - Uses `compareSqlValues` for proper NULL handling
- **Collation-aware partitioning** - PARTITION BY and ranking keys use shared key serialization (`util/key-serializer.ts`) with per-column collation normalizers resolved against the connection's collation registry via `EmissionContext.resolveKeyNormalizer()` (e.g., NOCASE → case-insensitive grouping; a custom `registerCollation` normalizer is honored too)

**Execution Model:**
1. **Materialization**: Collects all input rows (required for window functions)
2. **Partitioning**: Groups rows by PARTITION BY expressions
3. **Sorting**: Orders rows within partitions by ORDER BY expressions
4. **Frame Processing**: Calculates window frames and computes function values
5. **Output**: Returns original rows augmented with window function results

## Frame Specification Support

The implementation correctly handles all SQL standard frame types:

```sql
{ROWS | RANGE} {
    UNBOUNDED PRECEDING |
    CURRENT ROW |
    <value> PRECEDING |
    <value> FOLLOWING |
    BETWEEN <start_bound> AND <end_bound>
}
```

**Default Frame Behavior:**
- **No ORDER BY**: Frame includes entire partition
- **With ORDER BY**: Frame is `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`

**RANGE vs ROWS:**
- **ROWS**: Frame bounds are physical row offsets from the current row
- **RANGE**: Frame bounds are value-based offsets on the first ORDER BY expression. `CURRENT ROW` includes all peer rows (rows with the same ORDER BY values)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Window Functions

```sql
-- Row numbering
SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees;

-- Partitioned ranking
SELECT name, department,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
FROM employees;
```

### Frame Specifications

```sql
-- Running totals
SELECT date, amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as running_total
FROM transactions;

-- Moving averages
SELECT date, value,
       AVG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) as moving_avg
FROM measurements;

-- RANGE frame: value-based window (include all rows within 10 of current value)
SELECT date, price,
       SUM(price) OVER (ORDER BY price RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND 10 FOLLOWING) as nearby_sum
FROM products;
```

### Navigation Functions

```sql
-- Access previous/next row values
SELECT date, amount,
       LAG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) as prev_amount,
       LEAD(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) as next_amount
FROM transactions;

-- With offset and default value
SELECT date, amount,
       LAG(amount, 2, 0) OVER (ORDER BY date) as two_back
FROM transactions;

-- First and last values in frame
SELECT date, amount,
       FIRST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY date) as first_in_month,
       LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY date
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as last_in_month
FROM transactions;
```

### Statistical Ranking

```sql
-- Percentile ranking and cumulative distribution
SELECT name, score,
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score) as pct_rank,
       CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY score) as cume_dist,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY score) as quartile
FROM test_results;
```

### NULL Handling

```sql
-- Explicit NULL ordering
SELECT name, score,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC NULLS LAST) as rank
FROM test_results;
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Window Specification Grouping

The planner automatically groups window functions with identical specifications:
- **Single sort pass** per unique window specification
- **Shared partition processing** for multiple functions  
- **Reduced memory usage** through specification reuse

### Efficient Execution

- **O(n) ranking pre-computation**: After sorting each partition, a single linear pass (`precomputeRankings`) detects peer group boundaries and computes RANK, DENSE_RANK, PERCENT_RANK, and CUME_DIST for all rows at once. Per-row ranking lookups are then O(1).
- **Pre-evaluated ORDER BY values**: Sort keys are evaluated once and cached in `orderByValues`, reused for sorting, peer detection, and frame bounds — no re-evaluation of expressions.
- **Partitioned functions**: Buffer only current partition
- **Frame-bounded aggregates**: Process only necessary frame data

### Streaming fast path over `MonotonicOn`

When the source already arrives in `[PARTITION BY..., ORDER BY[0]]` order — its
`physical.monotonicOn` covers the leading ORDER BY key and `physical.ordering`
shows the partition keys as an emit-order prefix — `rule-monotonic-window` tags
the `WindowNode` with a `streaming` config and the runtime switches from the
buffer/sort path to a one-pass emitter (`runStreaming` in `runtime/emit/window.ts`).

The streaming emitter:

- Walks the source in source order, emitting in source order.
- Maintains `O(P)` per-partition state where `P` is the open partition (only one
  partition is alive at a time since input is partition-sorted), with sub-state
  per function: ranking counters, LAG ring buffers, LEAD read-ahead queues,
  FIRST_VALUE caches, and running-aggregate accumulators with peer-group
  buffering for RANGE-mode frames.
- Skips the sort entirely — `O(N log N)` per partition saved.
- Skips materialization — `O(N)` memory saved.
- Preserves the source's `monotonicOn` on the `WindowNode`'s output so
  downstream rules (`monotonic-limit-pushdown`, `monotonic-merge-join`,
  `monotonic-range-access`) compose cleanly above streaming windows.

**Recognized functions** (the rule fires only when *all* functions in a single
WindowNode are individually recognized):

| Function class | Recognized | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK` | yes | per-partition counter + last-key |
| `LAG`, `LEAD` | yes | offset must be a non-negative integer literal |
| `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE` | yes | LAST_VALUE only under default frame; both also stream under sliding frames (see below) |
| Running `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` | yes | default frame (`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING TO CURRENT ROW`, ROWS or RANGE) |
| Sliding `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE` | yes | `ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND m FOLLOWING` (literal `n,m ≥ 0`) or `RANGE BETWEEN <num> PRECEDING AND <num> FOLLOWING` (single numeric ORDER BY key, literal non-negative offsets) |
| `NTILE`, `PERCENT_RANK`, `CUME_DIST` | no | need partition size up-front |
| Asymmetric sliding (`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND m FOLLOWING`, `n PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`, `CURRENT ROW AND m FOLLOWING`) | no | future work |
| `DISTINCT` aggregates | no | future work |

**Bail conditions** (any one drops to the buffered path):

- The leading ORDER BY key is not a trivial column reference, or doesn't match
  source's `monotonicOn` direction.
- Source's `physical.ordering` doesn't cover the full ORDER BY key set.
- PARTITION BY columns aren't an emit-order prefix of the source ordering.
- Any partition-by expression is non-trivial (not a column reference).
- Any function falls outside the recognized set.
- Frame is anything other than the default (or the explicit equivalent
  `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING TO CURRENT ROW`), or a supported sliding shape (see
  the table above).
- For RANGE-mode sliding frames: more than one ORDER BY key (numeric RANGE
  offsets require a single sort key per the SQL standard).

### Sliding-frame state machine

Under a sliding frame, `runStreaming` keeps a per-function `slidingBuffer` of
`{argVal, orderByVal0}` for rows currently in scope plus a list of pending
entries awaiting finalization. Each pending entry's slot is filled as soon as
its right edge has been seen.

- **ROWS** — entries finalize when row `j + following` arrives. SUM/COUNT/AVG
  maintain a `{ sum, count }` accumulator with step+unstep (skipping NULL
  argVals); MIN/MAX/FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE recompute from the live buffer
  slice. Memory is `O(preceding + following + 1)` per function per partition.
- **RANGE** — entries finalize when a later arrival's value strictly exceeds
  `v_j + following` (right edge has passed). Frame values are computed by
  scanning the buffer for rows with `v ∈ [v_j - preceding, v_j + following]`
  (finite `v_j`) or the contiguous non-finite peer span (NULL / non-numeric
  `v_j`). Buffer is trimmed front-of-line as old rows fall out of every
  remaining pending entry's frame.

At partition close, all remaining pending entries are flushed with their
right edges clamped to the last row.

The rule id `monotonic-window` can be disabled via `tuning.disabledRules`. See
[Monotonic streaming-window recognition](./optimizer-streaming.md#monotonic-streaming-window-recognition).

## Testing

Window functions are comprehensively tested through SQL Logic Tests (`test/logic/07.5-window.sqllogic`):

- Basic functionality (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Partitioning with multiple expressions
- Complex ORDER BY with ASC/DESC and NULLS FIRST/LAST
- Frame specifications (ROWS BETWEEN, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING/FOLLOWING)
- Aggregate functions with window frames
- NULL handling and edge cases
- Multiple window functions in single query
- Collation-aware PARTITION BY (NOCASE grouping)
- Collation-aware ranking (DENSE_RANK / RANK with NOCASE ORDER BY)
- NULL PARTITION BY grouping (SQL standard: NULLs group together)
- Navigation functions (LAG, LEAD with offset/default, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE)
- Statistical ranking (PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST with ties)
- NTILE bucket distribution
- RANGE BETWEEN value-based frames (CURRENT ROW peers, N PRECEDING/FOLLOWING)

## Extensibility

New window functions can be added through the function registry system. A
registration is a single schema object (`WindowFunctionSchema`):

```typescript
registerWindowFunction({
    name: 'NEW_FUNC',
    argCount: 1,              // or 'variadic'
    returnType: { /* ScalarType */ },  // fallback type
    requiresOrderBy: false,
    kind: 'aggregate',       // 'ranking' | 'aggregate' | 'value' | 'navigation'
    step: (state, value) => { /* update state */ },
    final: (state, rowCount) => { /* return result */ }
});
```

**Return-type inference.** Pass-through functions whose result is the argument
value verbatim (`MIN`, `MAX`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, `LAG`, `LEAD`) supply
an optional `inferReturnType(argTypes) => ScalarType` that derives the result
type from `argTypes[0]` (the value expression) rather than the fixed
`returnType`. For `LAG`/`LEAD` the offset and default arguments do not widen the
result. When no argument types are available the planner falls back to the
declared `returnType`.

## Future Enhancements

**Advanced Features:**
- Named window specifications (WINDOW clause)
- Custom frame exclusion options

The window function implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced SQL analytics while maintaining the architectural principles of the Titan runtime system.
