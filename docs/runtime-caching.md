# Runtime Caching

> **Stability: Internal** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

Per-execution caches that live on the `RuntimeContext` and reset between
prepared-statement executions: inner-scan connection reuse, `CacheNode` row
caches, and shared (multi-reference) CTE materialization. Companion to
[Runtime § Common Patterns](runtime.md#common-patterns); the fork policy for
each cache field is declared in the `RuntimeContext` fork-contract table there.

## Inner-scan connection reuse

A nested-loop join whose inner (right) side is **not** wrapped in a cache node
re-scans the inner relation once per outer row (`runtime/emit/join.ts`
`driveFromLeft`). Each re-scan re-invokes the inner sub-program, including its
scan leaf (`emitSeqScan`, `runtime/emit/scan.ts`). Rather than
`module.connect(...)` + `disconnect(...)` the inner virtual table on every
re-scan (one connect/disconnect per outer row), the scan leaf connects the
instance **once per scan-site per execution** and reuses it across every
re-scan:

- The connected instances live in a per-execution cache on the
  `RuntimeContext` (`ctx.scanConnections`, a `Map<symbol, VirtualTable>`),
  keyed by a stable symbol minted in each `emitSeqScan` closure — so the key is
  identical across re-scans of one scan site but distinct from every other
  site. A self-join's two scan sites over one table therefore get **distinct**
  instances and never share a cursor (its single consumer drains each inner
  cursor sequentially before the next outer row, so one instance is never
  concurrently self-live).
- The scan leaf no longer disconnects in its `finally` (it still closes the
  per-invocation row slot each pass). Teardown happens once, in
  `Statement._iterateRowsRawInternal`'s `finally`, which disconnects every
  cached instance exactly once on all exit paths (completion, `break`, error,
  abort) after the consumer finishes draining.
- The cache lives on the per-execution `RuntimeContext`, so it resets between
  prepared-statement runs — a re-executed statement reconnects afresh.
- **Fallback:** the transient/analysis `RuntimeContext`s that don't set
  `scanConnections` (e.g. `Database._executeSingleStatement`, const-evaluation)
  make the scan leaf own the lifecycle: connect and disconnect per invocation,
  as before. Correct, just no reuse.

Reuse is visibility-neutral for the memory vtab, which reads live-at-`query()`
state (a reused instance's later `query()` observes the same state a fresh
connect would). The read scan connects `module.connect` directly and never
registers a `VirtualTableConnection`, so this is independent of the
`adoptConnection` / connection-registration path.


## CacheNode row-cache lifetime

`emitCache` (`src/runtime/emit/cache.ts`) materializes its source's rows on
first iteration and replays them on later re-iterations within the same
execution — used for uncorrelated `IN (subquery)` (`rule-in-subquery-cache`),
CTE materialization (`rule-cte-optimization`), and mutating-subquery caching
(`rule-mutating-subquery-cache`). The materialized `CacheState` (from
`src/runtime/cache/shared-cache.ts`) lives on the per-execution
`RuntimeContext` (`ctx.cacheStates`, a `Map<symbol, CacheState>`), keyed by a
symbol minted in the `emitCache` closure — the same pattern as
`scanConnections` above and `executionMemo`
([Runtime § Common Patterns](runtime.md#common-patterns)). Because the instruction tree
(and the closure that minted the key) is cached and reused across a prepared
statement's executions, tying the cache to the context rather than the
closure resets it between runs: a re-executed statement re-drives its cached
source and observes current data instead of replaying the first run's rows.

**Eager vs. streaming-first build.** `streamWithCache` has two build modes,
selected by `CacheNode.eager`. The default *streaming-first* mode yields each
source row as it arrives and only commits `cachedResult` after the source
drains to completion — great first-row latency, but a consumer that
short-circuits (breaks on an early row) aborts the generator before the drain
finishes, so the buffer is never committed and the next evaluation re-opens the
source. That defeats caching for `IN (subquery)`, whose `emitIn` returns on the
first matching row (`src/runtime/emit/subquery.ts`): while outer rows keep
matching early, the source is re-opened per outer row. So `rule-in-subquery-cache`
sets `eager: true`, which drains the source fully and commits the buffer
**before** yielding any row — the first-match short-circuit can no longer abort
the build, and every later outer row replays from cache (source opened once). If
the eager drain exceeds the cache threshold it abandons and streams the
remainder through (memory bound wins; later evals stream fresh). CTE,
nested-loop-right, and mutating-subquery caches keep `eager` defaulted `false`
for their first-row latency.

## Shared CTE materialization (multi-reference CTEs)

A non-recursive CTE referenced more than once (or hinted `MATERIALIZED`) is
marked `materialize` by the optimizer's materialization-advisory pass (see
`docs/optimizer.md` § Materialization Advisory). `emitCTE`
(`src/runtime/emit/cte.ts`) then evaluates the CTE **exactly once per statement
execution**, matching standard SQL `MATERIALIZED` semantics:

- Every `CTEReferenceNode` emits its own copy of the CTE's source subtree
  (`emitPlanNode` has no memoization), but all references share one `CTENode`
  instance — so each reference's `emitCTE` closure agrees on the buffer key,
  the CTENode's plan id.
- The buffer lives on the per-execution `RuntimeContext`
  (`ctx.cteMaterializations`, a `Map<string | TableDescriptor, Promise<Row[]>>` —
  non-recursive CTEs key by plan-id string, recursive CTEs by descriptor object;
  the two key spaces never collide). The first
  reference to run stores the buffer *promise* synchronously (before any
  `await`), then drives its source to completion; a second reference that
  interleaves — e.g. the two sides of a nested-loop self-join — finds the
  promise and awaits it instead of driving its own source subtree, which is
  therefore never iterated. This holds regardless of how references interleave,
  where a first-drain row cache (`CacheNode`) would still double-drive.
- Rows are copied on buffer-in and on yield so a downstream mutator cannot
  corrupt another reference's (or a later replay's) view.
- Per-execution lifetime gives the same staleness guarantee as `cacheStates`:
  a re-executed prepared statement re-materializes and observes current data.

Un-marked CTEs (single reference without a `MATERIALIZED` hint, or an explicit
`NOT MATERIALIZED`) keep the pure streaming path — early exit such as `LIMIT`
never drains the source.

**Recursive CTEs** run through the working-table machinery (`emitRecursiveCTE`),
not `emitCTE`, but follow the same buffer-once-replay pattern when referenced
2+ times:

- A **single-reference** recursive CTE stays on the streaming path (each drive
  emits its own semi-naïve loop). Streaming is required so an outer `LIMIT` can
  cut an unbounded recursion off before the iteration guard trips.
- A **multi-referenced** recursive CTE (e.g. joined to itself) is marked
  `materialize` on its `RecursiveCTENode` and buffered once per execution. Two
  interleaved streaming drives would clobber each other's delta on the shared
  working-table `tableDescriptor` — the recursion never terminates and trips the
  10 000-iteration guard. So the first reference to run drives the recursion to
  completion inside a detached async IIFE (draining independently of how the join
  pulls, which breaks the nested-loop deadlock) into a buffer keyed by the
  `tableDescriptor`; every reference replays it. The mark **ignores** the
  `MATERIALIZED` / `NOT MATERIALIZED` hint — honoring `NOT MATERIALIZED` here
  would re-introduce the runaway, so correctness wins.
- The buffer key is the `tableDescriptor`, **not** the plan id, because earlier
  optimizer passes duplicate a multi-referenced recursive CTE into distinct
  `RecursiveCTENode` instances (distinct plan ids) that all preserve the one
  `tableDescriptor`. The advisory marks every copy (it sums parent counts per
  descriptor) and additionally forbids caching anything inside a recursive-case
  subtree — a `CacheNode` there would freeze the semi-naïve delta to the first
  iteration's rows. See `docs/optimizer.md` § Materialization Advisory.
