# Documentation Conventions

How to write and maintain the design docs under `docs/`. Two mechanical gates back this
document: `yarn docs:check` (`scripts/check-docs.mjs`) fails the build on a broken link and
on a doc that has grown past its recorded size.

The problem this exists to prevent: two docs reached 38,000 and 28,500 words. At that size
nobody re-reads a doc against the code, so it drifts, and a doc that has drifted is worse
than no doc — it confidently tells the next developer something false.

## The three vocabularies

Almost every sentence in a topic doc is one of three things. They have different lifetimes
and different homes, and mixing them is what makes a doc unmaintainable.

**Normative invariant** — a statement the *code* must satisfy. Violating it is a bug, not a
missed optimization, and you can check it against the implementation by reading one file.

> Every registered optimizer rule declares `sideEffectMode`, and the registry rejects one
> that does not (`validateSideEffectMode`, `planner/framework/registry.ts`).

**Rationale** — why the design is shaped this way, including why *not* the alternatives.
Not checkable against code, but load-bearing: it stops the next person re-litigating a
settled call.

> "There is exactly one maintenance model — row-time — and no refresh-policy knob… The
> user never reasons about *when* the view is consistent." (`materialized-views.md`)

**Narrative history** — how the code got here. To a reader who does not already know it is
a changelog entry, it reads as current truth.

> "Historically 'same module ⇒ one atomic commit' did **not** hold even within the store
> module — a per-store `batch()` loop could tear a source and backing apart…"
> (once in `materialized-views.md`; deleted)

## Where each one goes

| Kind | Home |
| --- | --- |
| Normative invariant | The repo-wide register, `docs/invariants.md` |
| Rationale | The topic doc, including a `### Rejected alternatives` section |
| Narrative history | **Nowhere.** Delete it. |
| Future / planned work | `docs/todo.md`, or a ticket in `tickets/backlog/` |

**History is deleted, not archived.** Do not create `docs/archive/`. The project already
keeps two histories — `git log`, and `tickets/complete/`, which holds a written account of
every change. A third copy is a third thing that has to be kept true, and it will not be.

**The one exception is a rejected alternative.** When a passage says "we now do X; we used
to do Y" *and* gives the reason Y was wrong, that reason is rationale, not history — nobody
recovers it by grepping deleted text. Condense it to a single bullet under
`### Rejected alternatives` in the topic doc, and delete the rest of the passage.

**Future work leaves the docs.** A doc describing an unimplemented capability is
indistinguishable, to a reader, from a doc that has drifted. Move the passage to
`docs/todo.md` or a backlog ticket; leave at most a one-line pointer under
`## Current limitations`.

## The invariant register

`docs/invariants.md` is one file, read end-to-end against the code in one sitting. That is
the whole point of it — an invariant buried in the middle of a 38,000-word doc is an
invariant nobody audits.

**The register is the normative text.** A topic doc explains an invariant; the register
states it. When the two disagree, the register wins and the topic doc is the one to fix. A
topic-doc section an invariant summarizes carries a one-line
`> **Invariant:** [OPT-014](invariants.md#opt-014--an-attribute-id-is-originated-exactly-once)`
back-link near its heading, and does not restate the invariant. Back-links use the **full**
heading slug — an invariant heading's em dash slugifies to a double hyphen, so the short
`#opt-014` form does not resolve. `selfTest()` in the checker pins that form.

Copy the shape of an existing entry rather than working from a grammar restated here; the
checker's Check B is the source of truth. It enforces that each entry:

- has a heading `### <AREA>-<NNN> — <title>`, where `<AREA>` is one of `OPT`, `MV`, `RT`,
  `SCH`, `SYNC`, `LENS`. IDs are unique, and ascend within an area. Gaps are fine — a
  retired invariant's number is never reused.
- carries at least one `code:` line and **exactly one** `guard:` line. `guard: none — <reason>`
  is legal; a bare `guard: none` is not, because the reason is the point.
- names, on every `code:` / `guard:` / `doc:` line, a file that exists — and where the line
  ends in a `` `symbol` ``, a symbol that still appears in that file.
- states itself in **120 words or fewer**. An invariant you cannot state in 120 words is two
  invariants, or it is rationale wearing an invariant's clothes.

The checker validates *pointers*, not semantics: it asserts an invariant still names a real
file and a real symbol, never that the invariant holds. Pointer rot is the drift that
actually happens; semantic verification is what tests are for.

## The stability banner

Every user-facing feature doc declares which stability tier it belongs to, so a reader
knows how much a future release may break them before reading a line of the doc. The tier
definitions and the per-area assignment live in [Stability Tiers](stability.md); a doc
*states* its tier and *links* the definitions rather than restating them — the same
discipline as the invariant back-link above.

A tiered doc carries exactly one banner, directly under its `#` heading and before the intro:

```markdown
# View Updateability

> **Stability: Beta** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).
```

The tier word is one of `Stable`, `Beta`, `Experimental`, `Internal`, and must match the
doc's entry in `docs/.stability.json`, which is the machine-readable form of the same map.

A **section** may override its doc's tier by carrying the same banner under that section's
heading — that is how `declare schema` is marked Beta inside the Stable `sql.md`. The header
banner states the doc's predominant tier; section banners are the exceptions, and there is
never more than one banner in the window below the H1.

Contributor and process docs — this one, `architecture.md`, `invariants.md`, `releasing.md`,
the design notes — carry no banner and are listed under `untiered` in `docs/.stability.json`.
Every `docs/*.md` appears in one list or the other, except the frozen review artifacts
(`review.md`, `review.html`), which every doc check skips.

## The size ratchet

`docs/.doc-budget.json` records each large doc's current word count. A doc may shrink; it
may never grow past its recorded size. A doc with no entry must come in under `maxWords`
(12,000 — roughly the largest doc still readable end-to-end in one sitting).

Word count is whitespace-separated tokens over the whole file, fenced code included. A doc
whose bulk is code samples is just as unreviewable as one whose bulk is prose.

After a doc shrinks, lower its entry — this is expected routine, not an event:

```bash
node scripts/check-docs.mjs --update-ratchet
```

It only ever lowers. It refuses to raise or add an entry, and exits non-zero naming the doc
and the delta; a ratchet you can silently raise is not a ratchet. When a raise is genuinely
justified — say a convention adds a header line to every topic doc — `--update-ratchet --force`
will do it, and the commit message must carry a line saying why.

## Frozen artifacts

`docs/review.html` and `docs/review.md` are review artifacts. They describe a past state of
the codebase **on purpose**, are exempt from every check, and must not be "corrected."
