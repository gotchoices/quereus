# Lenses and Layered Schemas

## Overview

Quereus separates a database into three relational layers, in the Codd / ANSI-SPARC tradition but expressed entirely in Quereus's own primitives (all relations virtual, key-addressed, no rowids):

- **Logical** — the relations a developer designs and reasons about, free of any storage commitment. A logical schema declares tables with columns, types, and *logical* constraints (primary key, unique, check, foreign key, not null) and nothing physical: no module association, no indexes, no storage hints. It is a pure design.
- **Basis** — the relations that modules actually back. Basis tables are ordinary `using module(...)` tables and may be spread across many modules (a single logical table can map to a columnar decomposition over several basis tables). Basis is still *relational*; it is the lowest layer a developer reasons about as relations. Covering structures — secondary indexes, unique-enforcement structures — live here as materialized views (see [Materialized Views](#relationship-to-materialized-views)).
- **Mapping (the lens)** — for each logical table, a bidirectional relational expression that realizes it over basis relations. `get` is the query that produces the logical relation; `put` is the update propagation that pushes logical mutations down to basis. The lens is *not* a schema; it is a per-logical-table **slot**, populated either by explicit `declare lens` syntax or generated internally when absent.

Below basis sits the **physical** layer — module storage layout and the on-disk/in-memory realization of covering structures. The lens never sees physical concerns; it composes over basis relations, and modules handle storage beneath.

The decisive property is **decoupling**: a logical design carries no embodiment, so one logical schema can be paired with different basis schemas (a row-store, a columnar split, an exotic module) at different deployments. The lens is where a design meets a storage.

## What a Lens Is

A lens is the bidirectional-transformation (`get` / `put`) pair that Quereus's [view updateability](view-updateability.md) already provides: `get` is an ordinary `select`, and `put` is the existing predicate-driven propagation pass. The lens layer adds no new algebra. **There is exactly one operator set — relational algebra — used in both directions.** This is a deliberate design constraint:

- **`get` is relationally complete.** Any mapping expressible as a view is expressible as a lens, because a lens body *is* a view body.
- **`put` is the invertible fragment plus explicit disambiguation.** Not every relational expression has a sound, total inverse. Where propagation can infer the inverse it does; where it cannot, the gap is filled by explicit hints (`default_for`-style tags) or the mutation surfaces a structured diagnostic. Invertibility is made explicit rather than restricting the language.

To the query processor, a logical table is simply a view that is "out there, ready to go." Selecting from `Logical.T` resolves to the lens-compiled body over basis; mutating it propagates through that body via the standard view-update machinery. All lens-specific work happens at compile time: **validate, generate, and attach semantics**.

## Schema Kinds

`Schema` carries a `kind`:

- **`physical`** — module-backed schema. Tables declare `using module(...)`, may carry indexes (as index declarations or materialized views), storage tags, and the full physical surface.
- **`logical`** — declarative-only. Tables declare columns, types, logical constraints, and `with tags`. The following are rejected at build time for a logical schema: module association, indexes, and any physical storage construct. Tags *are* allowed — they are engine-facing metadata, not a physical commitment, and they survive into the compiled view.

There is no `lens` schema kind. The mapping for a logical table lives in that table's lens slot.

## The Lens Slot

Every logical table has one **lens slot** holding:

- the mapping body (a relational expression over basis), and
- the attachment of the logical spec's constraints and tags onto that body.

The slot is populated by one of two paths:

1. **Explicit** — a `declare lens` block supplies an override body for some logical tables (and may cover only some columns of a table).
2. **Generated** — when no override exists, or for columns an override does not cover, the default mapper generates the body.

At any deployment a logical table has exactly **one** active lens (its inlined body). Portability across embodiments is a *source-level* property — the same logical schema can be written against different lens+basis pairs for different targets — not a simultaneous-catalog property.

## The Default Mapper

When a lens body is not authored, it is generated. The generator is **module-specific and customizable**: the strategy of a standard row-store is the default, but modules can advertise their own logical→basis mapping so that exotic storage strategies (columnar decomposition, EAV, column-family) are accommodated without the developer authoring the join.

The default mapper is an **aligner over two independently-authored models**. Given a logical schema and a basis schema, it matches logical relations and columns to basis by name, type, and structure — and by module advertisements (e.g. "these five basis tables are a columnar decomposition sharing key `id`," from which the mapper generates the n-way join). The developer's overrides are *corrections to the alignment* plus intentional transforms; a rename is simply an alignment the developer overrode on purpose.

Three properties of the generated join are load-bearing for correctness:

- **Advertisements can be primary, not supplementary.** Name/type/structure matching works only when the basis surfaces logical column names. When a decomposition does not — generic value-columns, EAV triples, column-family layouts — the module advertisement is the *sole* alignment source and must carry enough to map each basis relation to the logical column(s) it backs. The advertisement also informs the **`put`** direction, not only `get`: it tells propagation the fan-out shape and the shared key (below), so an insert through the generated lens reaches every member of the decomposition.
- **Optional components are outer-joined.** A logical row may lack a value for a column that lives in a separate basis relation. The generated body must preserve such a row, so the mapper outer-joins optional components onto the relation that establishes row identity (the preserved side) and inner-joins only mandatory (`not null`) components. Inner-joining everywhere would silently drop rows missing an optional component.
- **The shared key need not be a logical key.** A module may join its basis relations on a **surrogate** key and carry the logical key as an ordinary value column. This is a deliberate choice with a consequence: when the shared key is a surrogate, evolution of the logical key (rename, retype, reshape) is a mapping-level edit, because the basis already treats the logical key as a value; when the shared key *is* the logical key, the same evolution is basis-invasive. A surrogate is supplied at insert by a basis-level default, and the load-bearing requirement is **evaluate-once-and-thread**: the surrogate is computed once per logical row and the same value is reused across every branch of the decomposition's fan-out, so all members of the n-way insert agree on identity. The default may be a **non-deterministic generator** (`uuid7()`, `nanoid()`, …) where the local DML policy permits non-determinism — the [change-capture layer](incremental-maintenance.md) records the *resolved* row, so reactive consumers, assertions, and replay see concrete values rather than the expression, which is the determinism guarantee that actually matters downstream. The mutation-context envelope (see [view-updateability §Mutation Context](view-updateability.md#mutation-context)) remains available where binding the seed at the statement level is preferred — e.g. to share it across multiple computed columns — but it is no longer required for surrogate generation.
- **The empty key (singleton) is the degenerate case, not a special path.** A logical table with `primary key ()` holds 0-or-1 rows. The primary key always decomposes to an existence relation whose arity equals the PK's arity, so a zero-arity PK yields a zero-column, 0-or-1-row existence relation — a basis singleton. The key-equi-join that stitches columns onto the anchor is a conjunction of per-key-column equalities; over a zero-column key that conjunction is empty, hence vacuously `true`, so the generated join reduces to `on true`:

  ```sql
  -- normal table: key = (id)            singleton: key = ()
  from   b_pk      x                     from   b_config__exists x   -- 0-or-1 row, no key, no value
  left join b_col1 c1 on c1.id = x.id    left join b_config_theme  t on true
  left join b_col2 c2 on c2.id = x.id    left join b_config_locale l on true;
  ```

  `left join … on true` is a left Cartesian product; with the anchor 0-or-1 row and each column relation 0-or-1 row, the result is 0-or-1 row — the singleton's cardinality. There is no surrogate to generate (with at most one row there is nothing to distinguish), and the existence anchor still matters for the same reason the multi-row PK store does: it lets the singleton exist with every column null, rather than collapsing "row exists" into "some column is set." The mandatory-column elision applies identically — a `not null` column's relation can serve as the anchor, dropping the separate existence relation.

## Sparse Overrides

The authoring goal is **override without takeover**: a developer renaming one column of a logical table that maps to an n-way join over columnar basis tables must not be forced to write the join. Two mechanisms make this work.

### The baseline is never authored text

The generated mapping is never written into source. The authored artifact contains **only deviations**, so the source is all signal and no noise — which is precisely why full code-generation fails (it buries the intentional, abnormal mappings in generated noise). The full effective mapping is inspectable on demand ("show effective mapping") but is not the thing the developer edits.

### Overrides are merged per-attribute, on the plan tree

An override authored as ordinary SQL is consumed as a **sparse patch keyed by attribute**, not as opaque text. At compile time, for each logical table:

1. The override `select` (if any) is parsed to a relational expression.
2. Its output **attribute provenance** is read — which logical columns it covers, and from which basis expressions. Overrides are addressed by **stable attribute ID**, not by name or position, so they survive regeneration of the baseline (this rides on the existing [attribute-provenance](optimizer.md#attribute-provenance) system).
3. For every logical column the override does not cover, the default mapper generates the mapping and composes it in.

So renaming a column and later adding a column compose cleanly: the rename override is untouched, and the new column appears as an uncovered attribute the mapper fills. The merge happens at the relational-plan level — Quereus has the full parser and attribute system — never at the text level.

Most overrides cap the generated body at the boundary (rename = projection-with-alias, hide = projection-away, compute = extend, filter = restrict) and never touch the join interior. A change that *must* reach inside the join (a column now originating from a different basis table) is genuinely structural, cannot reduce to a boundary cap, and therefore correctly costs more authoring and surfaces as signal.

## Constraint Attachment

A view predicate is a read-time filter, not a write-time invariant ([view-updateability §Interaction with Constraints](view-updateability.md#interaction-with-constraints)). The lens layer is therefore where the logical spec's constraints become **real constraints on the compiled view**, attached explicitly from the logical declaration rather than inferred from the body. Enforcement splits by class:

- **Row-local (`not null`, `check`)** — evaluable on the projected row being written, so a non-materialized lens enforces them for free at the write boundary. This is the common case; most mappings need nothing extra.
- **Set-level (`unique`, primary key)** — enforced by an existence lookup: "does a row with this key already exist?" The lookup uses a basis covering structure (a materialized index) when one exists — O(log n), row-time, which also enables `insert or replace` / `or ignore` conflict resolution — and otherwise falls back to the commit-time group/global assertion scan via `DeltaExecutor` (O(n), detection-only). The lookup is local and synchronous. A module with deferred or eventually-consistent semantics may admit two conflicting keys transiently and converge later; there the lens-level lookup is advisory at write time and the module owns the convergence rule (e.g. a last-writer-wins by the module's own ordering). The lens attaches the constraint; the strength of the guarantee it yields is the module's to honor.
- **Foreign key** — a cross-relation existence invariant, enforced at commit via `DeltaExecutor` against the referenced relation. A covering structure is optional.

This realizes the principle that **a constraint is a logical claim, and the structure that enforces it is an optional physical optimization** — see [Materialized Views](#relationship-to-materialized-views).

**A logical `unique` (or primary key) creates no structure.** Declaring `unique(x, y)` in a logical schema contributes a key/FD to the optimizer and an enforced boundary constraint — but it does **not** auto-create an index. This is a deliberate departure from the legacy behavior where `unique(...)` eagerly built a secondary BTree at declaration time (`LayerManager.ensureUniqueConstraintIndexes`), fusing the logical claim with a physical structure. In the layered model the two are separated: the constraint is logical, and any covering index is an explicit, independent **basis-layer** declaration (a materialized view with `order by`). With no such structure the constraint is still correct — enforced by the commit-time `DeltaExecutor` scan — just not O(log n). Whether to add the covering index is a physical-tuning decision made against the basis, never a side effect of the logical declaration.

That basis covering index is kept **write-through current** automatically: a covering `order by` materialized view is maintained synchronously with each source row-write — the single, row-time materialization model in Quereus ([Materialized Views § Maintenance](materialized-views.md#maintenance-row-time-per-statement)), which is precisely the consistency a row-time existence lookup needs. Both the *maintenance* capability and the *routing* of `unique` enforcement through the covering MV's backing table (the in-place `insert or replace` / `or ignore` / `abort` resolution, with the conflicting source row recovered from the MV projection) are **delivered** for the covering-index shape — see [Materialized Views § Enforcement through a covering MV](materialized-views.md#enforcement-through-a-covering-mv-delivered). A linked covering MV is thus a conflict-resolution-capable enforcement structure: the obligation `lens-prover-and-constraint-attachment` depends on — a row-time existence lookup that yields `insert or replace` / `or ignore` resolution — is satisfiable. (Today `findIndexForConstraint` *prefers* such an MV over the legacy auto-index; once the auto-index is retired in the logical-schema world, the covering MV becomes the sole structure.)

## Computed and Generated Columns

A logical column need not map to stored basis data — it can be **computed** by the lens `get`. Such a column has `computed` lineage ([view-updateability §The Update Site Model](view-updateability.md#the-update-site-model)): reads evaluate the expression, writes are rejected. This is how a generated/derived column is expressed — there is no separate `generated as` construct at the logical layer; a column is generated precisely when its lens body computes it and no `put` inverse exists. A computed column with an invertible body remains writable, by the ordinary scalar-invertibility rules; "generated" is just the non-invertible end of that spectrum.

Two timings look alike but land in different layers, and conflating them is a common error:

- **Standing computed column** — re-evaluated on every read, never stored, tracks its inputs forever. It lives in the lens `get`. `full_name = first || ' ' || last` is standing.
- **One-shot derivation** — evaluated once, at deploy, to populate stored basis data, then maintained as ordinary storage that can diverge from whatever produced it. This is a **backfill** (see [Deployment](#deployment-is-a-compile-step)), not a lens compute. Promoting a standing computed column to stored basis — to index it, or to let it diverge — is exactly a one-shot derivation.

The distinction is the same one that separates a view expression from a materialized derivation: one is recomputed, the other is computed once and stored. The lens `get` expresses the first; the deploy/backfill step expresses the second.

Because the logical spec and the lens body are authored (or generated) independently, the lens layer **proves they agree**. Each constraint in the logical spec plays one of two roles, decided by whether the lens body already guarantees it:

- **Body proves it** → the spec entry is a *proof obligation* (a completeness check). It contributes keys/FDs to the optimizer at zero enforcement cost. Example: the spec declares `unique(x,y)` and the body is `group by x,y`, or `select * from t` where basis already guarantees it. The primitive that discharges this class is `proveEffectiveKeyUnique` in `planner/analysis/coverage-prover.ts` ([Optimizer § Effective-key proving](optimizer.md#effective-key-proving-body-proves-it)): it proves the compiled body's *output* relation is unique on the logical key columns via the body's effective key (FD closure). The lens prover owns the logical-column → output-column mapping and feeds the output-column indices to the primitive. Note this proves a property of the *derived* relation — it is **not** a base-table covering structure (see [Materialized Views § Covering structures](materialized-views.md#covering-structures)).
- **Body does not prove it** → the spec entry is an *enforced boundary constraint*, per [Constraint Attachment](#constraint-attachment).

These proof obligations are the lens laws restated in Quereus's own terms: **PutGet** ("the mapping loses no logical guarantee") and **GetPut** ("round-tripping basis through the lens is faithful") are exactly the cross-checks that the compiled view's inferred FD / key / domain surface conforms to the logical spec. The two laws bind the two directions, and the [coverage checklist](#coverage-checklist) discharges each: `get` preserving the logical guarantees is *column coverage* plus *type/nullability conformance* plus *constraint realizability*; `put` faithfully reaching storage is *key reconstructibility* plus *round-trip*. A lens that satisfies the first group but not the second is readable yet not faithfully writable — the prover reports the uncovered write paths rather than presenting the relation as updatable. The prover is a consumer of the same key-inference surface the optimizer uses; what it cannot prove, it reports — it never silently assumes coverage.

### Coverage checklist

At compile the prover walks every logical aspect and confirms it is mapped to, and covered by, the basis. Each check has a severity: an **error** blocks the compile (the mapping is unsound or incomplete); a **warning** is advisory (the mapping is correct but suboptimal).

**Errors — the logical surface is not fully realized:**

| Check | Failure |
|---|---|
| **Column coverage** | Every logical column resolves to a basis expression (override or generated gap). An uncovered column errors, naming the column. |
| **Type / nullability conformance** | Each mapped column's basis-derived type and nullability satisfy the logical declaration. A nullable basis expression under a `not null` logical column errors unless a total default or guard supplies a value. |
| **Constraint realizability** | Each logical constraint is either *proven* by the body or *attachable* as an enforced boundary constraint (per [Constraint Attachment](#constraint-attachment)). A constraint that is neither — e.g. one referencing a column whose lineage is `computed` (no write path) — errors. |
| **Key reconstructibility** | For a writable logical table, the logical primary key is reconstructible at the lens boundary (a row-identifying predicate exists). Otherwise the table is read-only and any mutation against it errors. |
| **Round-trip (lens laws)** | GetPut / PutGet hold over the writable fragment. An override whose `put` is non-invertible and undisambiguated errors, naming the operator/column (the same diagnostic surface as [view updateability](view-updateability.md#diagnostics)). |

**Warnings — correct but suboptimal:**

| Check | Advisory |
|---|---|
| **No backing index for a set-level constraint** | A `unique` / primary key (or FK existence) with no basis covering structure is enforced by the O(n) commit-time `DeltaExecutor` scan. The prover warns and recommends a basis covering index (a materialized view with `order by` over the constraint columns), noting that row-time conflict resolution (`insert or replace` / `or ignore`) *requires* that structure and is otherwise rejected. |
| **No answering structure for a declared access pattern** | If the logical schema (or its tags) declares an expected lookup/ordering with no basis ordering or index to serve it, the prover warns that reads will scan. |
| **Partial override** | When an override covers only some columns of a table and the remainder took the default alignment, the prover emits an informational note listing the gap-filled columns, so the generated portion is visible. |

Warnings are reported through the same channel as the compile result (and surfaced in the deploy summary); they never block a deploy. The backing-index warning is the lens layer's single most important advisory, because it is the one place where the "structure is optional, correctness isn't" separation has a visible performance cost the developer should consciously accept or remedy.

### Acknowledging advisories

Advisories only reduce noise if acknowledged ones stay out of the way — but an acknowledgment must never hide a *newly* important problem. The mechanism balances both:

- **Coded and sited.** Every advisory carries a stable code (`lens.no-backing-index`, `lens.no-answering-structure`, `lens.partial-override`) and the logical site it concerns (table / constraint), so an acknowledgment targets exactly one advisory, never a class.
- **Acknowledged in source, via a reserved tag.** A `quereus.lens.ack.<code>` tag on the logical table or constraint suppresses that advisory from the default report. Because the ack lives in the logical declaration, it is version-controlled and shows up in review — there is no hidden, out-of-band suppress-list. The tag value is a **required rationale** (an empty or missing rationale is itself a warning), so every suppression carries its justification.
- **Tallied, never vanished.** The deploy summary always reports `acknowledged: N` and can expand them on demand. The default view is decluttered; nothing becomes truly invisible.
- **Re-surfaces on material change.** The prover fingerprints the facts behind each advisory (constraint columns, the absence of a covering structure, a coarse cardinality band, …) and the tooling records that fingerprint when the ack is written. If the facts later diverge — the table crosses the cardinality band, the constraint columns change, a previously-present index is dropped — the fingerprint no longer matches and the advisory **re-surfaces as un-acknowledged**, flagged *"previously acknowledged; situation changed."* This is the anti-fatigue guarantee that still catches the thing that matters. A hand-written ack with no recorded fingerprint is honored but marked *unconditional* — the author has explicitly opted out of re-surfacing.
- **Escalation policy.** A deploy policy promotes specific codes beyond advisory:
  - `error-on: [code]` — the code is always a hard error; an ack cannot suppress it. For invariants you never permit.
  - `require-ack: [code]` — an un-acknowledged instance is an error, but a valid (fingerprint-matched) ack with rationale clears it. This is the sweet spot for `lens.no-backing-index`: it forces a conscious, documented decision without blocking the developer who has genuinely accepted the commit-time scan.

```sql
declare logical schema X {
  table Car (
    id int primary key,
    vin text,
    unique (vin)
  ) with tags (
    "quereus.lens.ack.no-backing-index:vin" = 'low-write table; commit-time scan is acceptable'
  );
}
```

Acknowledgment suppresses the *warning* only; it has no effect on an `error-on` escalation or on any correctness error from the [coverage checklist](#coverage-checklist).

## Deployment Is a Compile Step

Quereus is a query-processing engine, not a deployment system, but it exposes the ingredients an application needs to assemble a complete deployment story. Deploying a logical schema against a basis is a **compile**:

1. **Generate / diff the basis.** The basis is a generated-then-frozen artifact. On each deploy it is diffed against the deployed representation by the declarative-schema differ. Logical evolution produces *additive* basis diffs (new column / table). A column removed from the logical schema does **not** cascade to a basis drop: the mapping detaches and the basis column is retained for later garbage collection. This asymmetry — logical removals never drop basis storage — is what keeps the basis append-mostly and migrations safe.
2. **Compile the lens.** For each logical table, merge the override (if any) with generated gaps into an effective view body over basis, addressed by stable attribute ID.
3. **Register inline.** `Logical.X.T` resolves to that effective body; the query processor sees an ordinary view. The logical spec's constraints are attached at the lens boundary.

The authored source stays sparse (signal only). The *compiled* effective mapping is the inspectable, generated-on-demand artifact (the noise). Because the basis is frozen and the effective lens is recomputed at compile from frozen inputs, the result is deterministic, not a moving target.

### The deployed basis representation

Migrations require a stable record of *what is deployed*, so that augmentations can be generated against it and basis invariants verified to be intact. The deployed basis is therefore persisted and **hash-coded** (reusing the schema hasher). A deploy compares the freshly generated basis against the deployed hash, computes the additive diff, and — for data-effecting changes (column adds with backfill, decomposition changes) — emits DDL the application can run with custom backfills, exactly as the declarative-schema pipeline already supports. Schema-only changes (rename, hide) are metadata; data-effecting changes (split / merge / pivot) carry a backfill obligation.

A useful subset of that backfill obligation is **engine-expressible rather than fully delegated**. When the new basis can be populated by running the new lens `get` over the prior basis — a pure re-decomposition such as a split or merge that introduces no information the prior basis lacks — the differ can emit the backfill as generated DDL, the same shape as the one-shot derivation of [Computed and Generated Columns](#computed-and-generated-columns). Only backfills that need data the prior basis does not contain remain the application's to supply. The obligation thus splits cleanly: re-decompositions the engine can generate from the lens itself, genuinely new information the application provides.

## Relationship to Materialized Views

Indexes are a basis-layer concern, expressed as **materialized views**: a materialized view with an `order by` describes a clustered/ordered structure — an index. A unique *constraint* is a logical claim (it lives in the logical schema); the *index* that covers it is a basis-layer materialized view. The two legitimately sit at opposite ends of the stack, and the lens carries the constraint down to a level where it is enforceable while the index attaches at basis.

Unique enforcement is a key existence lookup against that covering materialized view when present (row-time, conflict-resolution-capable), falling back to a commit-time `DeltaExecutor` scan when absent. See [Materialized Views](materialized-views.md) for the keyed-derived-relation framing, covering-structure semantics, and the incremental-maintenance path.

**Surface already shipped.** The unified covering-structure surface this layer consumes — the `CoveringStructure` discriminated union (`memory-index` | `materialized-view`), the eager constraint↔structure linking (`UniqueConstraintSchema.coveringStructureName` ↔ `MaterializedViewSchema.covers`), and the coverage prover that recognizes a covering `order by` MV — lands with the [covering-structure work](materialized-views.md#covering-structures). The **write-through prerequisite is satisfied for the covering-index shape**: a materialized view keeps its backing table consistent synchronously with each source row-write, within the transaction — the single row-time materialization model ([Materialized Views § Maintenance](materialized-views.md#maintenance-row-time-per-statement)) — so a covering MV is *kept current at write time*, which is what a row-time existence lookup requires. Routing `unique` enforcement through that backing table for conflict resolution is **delivered** for the covering-index shape ([Materialized Views § Enforcement through a covering MV](materialized-views.md#enforcement-through-a-covering-mv-delivered)). The logical-schema world — where the auto-index is retired and an explicit covering MV becomes the *sole* enforcement structure — is where that path is load-bearing (`lens-prover-and-constraint-attachment`). Where no covering structure answers a constraint, the commit-time `DeltaExecutor` scan governs the gap (the `lens.no-answering-structure` advisory).

## Syntax

```sql
-- Logical: design only. Constraints and tags allowed; no module, no indexes.
declare logical schema X {
  table Car (
    id int primary key,
    maxSpeed int,
    ...
  ) with tags ("domain.unit.maxSpeed" = 'kph');
}

-- Basis: today's physical schema — module-backed tables plus index materialized views.
declare schema Y {
  table CarCore (id int primary key, ...) using mem();
  table CarPerf (id int primary key, speed int, ...) using mem();
  create materialized view ix_carperf_speed as
    select speed, id from CarPerf order by speed;   -- clustered index over CarPerf
}

-- Lens: binds logical X to default basis Y; supplies sparse overrides.
declare lens for X over Y {
  view Car as
    select id, speed as maxSpeed              -- rename override
    from Y.CarCore join Y.CarPerf using (id);  -- other Car columns gap-filled
  -- tables of X not mentioned here are auto-mapped against Y entirely
}
```

- `declare logical schema X { ... }` — `kind: 'logical'`, declarative end-state, diffed by the schema differ.
- `declare lens for X over Y { ... }` — names the logical schema (`for X`) and the default basis (`over Y`), and populates lens slots. Unmentioned tables are auto-mapped; columns unmentioned within a mentioned table are gap-filled. The basis binding lives on the lens, never on the logical schema — that is what keeps the logical schema embodiment-free and lets one logical schema target multiple bases across deployments.

## Implementation Surface

Status legend: **shipped** (landed by `lens-foundation-and-default-mapper`) / **pending** (a named follow-up ticket).

- **shipped** — `src/schema/schema.ts` — `Schema.kind: 'physical' | 'logical'` (default `'physical'`), plus the per-`Schema` lens-slot registry.
- **shipped** — `src/schema/table.ts` — `vtabModule` is optional and `isLogical?: boolean` added; the logical-table spec is built (columns + constraints, no module) and held in the lens slot, while its compiled effective body is registered as an ordinary `ViewSchema` so reads ride the existing view path and writes ride [view updateability](view-updateability.md). (The compiled body is a registered view, not a `viewDefinition`-carrying `TableSchema` — see the audit note below.)
- **shipped** — `src/schema/lens.ts` — the per-logical-table lens slot (`LensSlot`): logical-table spec, default-basis binding (`SchemaRef`), compiled effective body, attached constraints (`LogicalConstraint`). `override` is present in the type but always `undefined` until the override ticket.
- **shipped** — `src/parser/parser.ts` + `src/parser/ast.ts` + `src/emit/ast-stringify.ts` — parse `declare logical schema X { ... }` (the `LOGICAL` contextual keyword sets `DeclareSchemaStmt.isLogical`), and round-trip it back to DDL. **pending** — `declare lens for … over …` (override surface).
- **shipped** — `src/schema/lens-compiler.ts` — the default **name-based aligner** (single-source, v1): aligns each logical table/column to a basis table/column by name, emits the inline effective view body, infers the default basis, and rejects physical constructs under a logical schema. Wired into `apply schema X` (`runtime/emit/schema-declarative.ts`). **pending** — per-attribute merge of override ⊕ generated gaps (override ticket); n-way decomposition (decomposition ticket).
- **pending** — `src/schema/lens-prover.ts` — proves the compiled body's FD / key / domain surface conforms to the logical spec (the PutGet / GetPut completeness checks); reports unproven obligations. Until it lands, **type/nullability conformance is not gated** and the attached constraints are stored verbatim, not yet routed to enforcement.
- **shipped (partial)** — `src/schema/schema-differ.ts`, `src/schema/schema-hasher.ts` — kind-aware diffing (logical per-table diff is attach/detach-lens, never a basis-table drop; the logical-removals-do-not-drop-basis asymmetry), and the schema hash covers the schema kind + logical declarations. **pending** — the deployed-basis hash record / engine-emitted re-decomposition backfill DDL (`lens-re-decomposition-backfill-ddl`).
- **pending** — Module mapping advertisement — modules optionally advertise a default logical→basis mapping strategy consumed by the aligner (`lens-module-mapping-advertisement`).

The lens layer introduces no new runtime: at execution time a logical table is an inlined view, driven by the existing optimizer, [view updateability](view-updateability.md), and [materialized-view](materialized-views.md) machinery. All lens-specific behavior is compile-time validate / generate / attach.

### Audit note: logical-table representation (v1)

The compiled effective body of each logical table is registered as a **`ViewSchema`** (`Schema.addView`), so `select` from `Logical.T` resolves through the standard view path and mutation rides view updateability with zero new runtime. The logical spec itself (columns / types / constraints — the surface a `ViewSchema` cannot carry) lives in the **lens slot** (`schema/lens.ts`), keyed by logical table name on the owning `Schema`. The override and prover tickets read the spec from the slot, not from `Schema.getTable()`. This reconciles the design intent ("the query processor sees an ordinary view") with the audited reality that read/write resolution goes through `ViewSchema` / `getView()`, not `TableSchema.viewDefinition`.

## Background

- **Codd, E. F. (1970); ANSI-SPARC three-schema architecture.** The external / conceptual / internal separation. Quereus's logical / mapping / basis layering is this separation expressed over virtual, key-addressed relations.
- **Foster et al. (2007). "Combinators for Bidirectional Tree Transformations" (lenses).** The `get` / `put` formulation and the GetPut / PutGet laws. Quereus realizes lenses without a dedicated combinator language — relational algebra is the lens vocabulary, and the laws become the completeness checks the lens prover discharges.
- **Date & Darwen, "The Third Manifesto."** Any relation expression is a first-class mutation target — the basis on which a logical table can be an inlined, mutable view.
- **Dataphor (Alphora, D4).** Precedent for view-as-first-class-target with mapping metadata; Quereus extends it with FD/EC-driven default recovery and the sparse-override-over-generated-baseline authoring model.

## Departures and Non-Goals

| Topic | Quereus | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Logical-table indexes | Not allowed. | Indexes are basis-layer materialized views; logical is embodiment-free. |
| Auto-index for `unique` / PK | Never. | The legacy eager BTree (`ensureUniqueConstraintIndexes`) is replaced: the constraint is logical, any covering index is a separate basis-layer declaration. |
| `with check option` on a lens | Not a separate feature. | Constraints are attached from the logical spec and enforced at the lens boundary; predicates remain read-time filters. |
| Separate lens algebra | None. | Relational algebra is the lens vocabulary in both directions. |
| Deployment orchestration | Out of scope. | Quereus exposes generate / diff / hash / emit-DDL ingredients; the application assembles the deployment. |
