# Quereus Type System

> **Stability: Stable** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

## Overview

Quereus implements a **logical type system** that separates type semantics from physical storage representation. This design provides strict type safety and extensibility while maintaining runtime performance.

### Core Principles

1. **Logical vs Physical Separation**: Types define validation and comparison semantics (logical) while values are stored using a small set of physical representations
2. **Strict Typing**: All type checking is strict - no implicit coercion between incompatible types
3. **Type-Specific Collations**: Collations are associated with specific types (primarily TEXT-based types)
4. **Plugin Extensibility**: Custom types can be registered via plugins
5. **Performance First**: Type information enables optimized comparisons without runtime type detection

### Design Decisions

- **Collations**: Type-specific. TEXT types support BINARY/NOCASE/RTRIM; numeric and temporal types have natural ordering
- **Type Enforcement**: Always strict - values must match declared types or be explicitly converted via conversion functions
- **Type Conversion**: Use functions like `integer()`, `text()`, `date()` instead of CAST syntax (though CAST is supported for compatibility)
- **Date/Time**: Native DATE, TIME, DATETIME types using Temporal API internally, stored as ISO 8601 strings
- **JSON**: Native JSON type with `PhysicalType.OBJECT` — values stored as JS objects in memory, serialized to JSON strings on disk
- **Constraints**: Length, precision, and other restrictions handled via CHECK constraints, not type definitions

## Type System Architecture

### Physical Types

Physical types represent how values are stored in memory and on disk:

```typescript
export enum PhysicalType {
  NULL = 0,
  INTEGER = 1,    // number | bigint
  REAL = 2,       // number (floating point)
  TEXT = 3,       // string
  BLOB = 4,       // Uint8Array
  BOOLEAN = 5,    // boolean
  OBJECT = 6,     // object (for JSON, custom types)
}

export type SqlValue = string | number | bigint | boolean | Uint8Array | JsonSqlValue | null;
// JsonSqlValue = { [key: string]: JSONValue } | JSONValue[]
```

### Logical Types

Logical types define the semantics and behavior of values:

```typescript
export interface LogicalType {
  // Identity
  name: string;                              // e.g., "DATE", "INTEGER", "TEXT"
  physicalType: PhysicalType;                // Physical storage representation

  // Validation
  validate?(value: SqlValue): boolean;       // Check if value is valid for this type
  parse?(value: SqlValue): SqlValue;         // Convert/normalize value to canonical form

  // Comparison
  compare?(a: SqlValue, b: SqlValue, collation?: CollationFunction): number;
  supportedCollations?: readonly string[];   // Which collations apply to this type

  // Serialization
  serialize?(value: SqlValue): SqlValue;     // Convert for storage/export
  deserialize?(value: SqlValue): SqlValue;   // Convert from storage

  // Metadata
  isNumeric?: boolean;
  isTextual?: boolean;
  isTemporal?: boolean;

  // Sargable-range support (optional)
  // For monotone-but-lossy transforms (e.g. `date(ts) = D`), compute the
  // half-open range `[lowerInclusive, upperExclusive)` on the input value.
  // `kind` is named by the function schema's `rangeRewriteOnArg` trait;
  // see docs/optimizer-rules.md § "Sargable range rewrites".
  bucketBounds?(
    kind: string,
    value: SqlValue,
  ): { lowerInclusive: SqlValue; upperExclusive: SqlValue } | undefined;
}
```

### Column Schema

Columns reference logical types:

```typescript
export interface ColumnSchema {
  name: string;
  logicalType: LogicalType;
  notNull: boolean;
  primaryKey: boolean;
  defaultValue: Expression | null;
  collation?: string;  // Must be in logicalType.supportedCollations
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Scalar Type

Plan nodes use ScalarType which includes the logical type:

```typescript
export interface ScalarType {
  typeClass: 'scalar';
  logicalType: LogicalType;
  nullable: boolean;
  collationName?: string;
  /** Provenance of collationName: 'explicit' | 'declared' | 'default' (absent = 'default'). */
  collationSource?: CollationSource;
  isReadOnly?: boolean;
}
```

This ensures type information flows through the entire planning and execution pipeline.

## Built-in Types

### Numeric Types

**INTEGER**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.INTEGER`
- Values: `number` (safe integers) or `bigint`
- Comparison: Numeric ordering
- Collations: None

**REAL**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.REAL`
- Values: `number` (floating point)
- Comparison: Numeric ordering with NaN handling
- Collations: None

**BOOLEAN**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.BOOLEAN`
- Values: `boolean` (true/false)
- Comparison: false < true
- Collations: None

### Text Types

**TEXT**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.TEXT`
- Values: `string`
- Comparison: Collation-based
- Collations: BINARY (default), NOCASE, RTRIM, custom

### Binary Types

**BLOB**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.BLOB`
- Values: `Uint8Array`
- Comparison: Byte-by-byte
- Collations: None

### Temporal Types

**DATE**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.TEXT` (ISO 8601 string: "YYYY-MM-DD")
- Values: ISO date strings
- Validation: Must parse as a valid bare PlainDate, or as a datetime string (bare, offset, `Z`, or `[zone]`) from which a date can be extracted
- Comparison: Lexicographic (ISO strings sort correctly)
- Collations: None
- Canonicalization: A datetime-shaped input is first converted to UTC (offset / `Z` / `[zone]` annotations honored), then the UTC date is stored. Numeric inputs (Unix milliseconds) are likewise canonicalized through UTC.

**TIME**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.TEXT` (ISO 8601 string: "HH:MM:SS.sss")
- Values: ISO time strings
- Validation: Must parse as a valid bare PlainTime, or as a datetime string (bare, offset, `Z`, or `[zone]`) from which a time can be extracted
- Comparison: Lexicographic
- Collations: None
- Canonicalization: A datetime-shaped input is first converted to UTC, then the UTC wall-clock time is stored — `'2024-01-15T10:30:00+02:00'` stores as `'08:30:00'`, not `'10:30:00'`.

**DATETIME**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.TEXT` (ISO 8601 string: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sss")
- Values: ISO datetime strings
- Validation: Must parse as valid Temporal.PlainDateTime, Temporal.ZonedDateTime, or Temporal.Instant
- Comparison: Lexicographic (by UTC wall-clock — see canonicalization below)
- Collations: None
- Canonicalization: Inputs with an offset (`+HH:MM` / `Z`) or `[zone]` annotation are converted to UTC, and numeric inputs (Unix milliseconds) are canonicalized through UTC, before being stored as the bare PlainDateTime form. Equal instants compare equal regardless of input shape.

**TIMESPAN**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.TEXT` (ISO 8601 duration string: "PT1H30M", "P1DT2H")
- Values: ISO 8601 duration strings
- Validation: Must parse as valid Temporal.Duration
- Comparison: Total duration comparison (normalized to seconds)
- Collations: None
- Arithmetic: Supports addition/subtraction with DATE, TIME, DATETIME types
- Human-readable parsing: `timespan('1 hour 30 minutes')` → `"PT1H30M"`

### Special Types

**NULL**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.NULL`
- Values: `null` only
- Used for expressions that always return NULL

**JSON**
- Physical: `PhysicalType.OBJECT`
- Values: Native JS objects, arrays, and JSON-compatible primitives (stored in memory as-is)
- Validation: Must be valid JSON; accepts objects, arrays, numbers, booleans, strings (parsed as JSON), and null
- Comparison: Deep structural comparison (`deepCompareJson`). **Object key order is not significant** — `{a:1,b:2}` equals `{b:2,a:1}` — but **array element order is** (positional). Numeric storage class holds, so a JSON scalar `5` equals `5.0`.
- Keys: hash keys (GROUP BY / DISTINCT / join partitioning) and persisted byte keys (JSON PK / index) derive from a **single canonical form** (`canonicalJsonString` — recursive object-key sort, arrays positional) so a value's key always agrees with the comparator: reorder-equal objects group/de-dup/conflict as one, distinct objects never over-merge. The canonical form is used **only to derive keys** — never for storage or display.
- Collations: None
- Serialization: `serialize()` converts to JSON string for storage; `deserialize()` parses back to native object. Storage and display preserve **insertion order** (only key derivation canonicalizes)
- Conversion: `json(value)` parses a JSON string into a native object; inserting a JSON string into a JSON column auto-parses it
- Functions: All `json_*` functions accept both native objects and JSON strings as input

---

## Type Validation

Values are validated at INSERT/UPDATE boundaries:

```typescript
export function validateValue(value: SqlValue, type: LogicalType): SqlValue {
  if (value === null) return null;

  // Type-specific validation
  if (type.validate && !type.validate(value)) {
    throw new QuereusError(
      `Type mismatch: expected ${type.name}, got ${typeof value}`,
      StatusCode.MISMATCH
    );
  }

  // Type-specific parsing/normalization
  if (type.parse) {
    return type.parse(value);
  }

  return value;
}
```

### Explicit Conversion

Use type conversion functions for explicit conversion:

```sql
-- Convert string to integer
select integer('123');

-- Convert timestamp to date
select date(1234567890);

-- Convert string to real
select real('3.14');

-- Invalid conversion throws error
select integer('abc');  -- Error: Type mismatch

-- Conversion functions are just regular scalar functions
select text(42);           -- '42'
select boolean(1);         -- true
select datetime('2024-01-15T10:30:00');
```

**Built-in Conversion Functions**:
- `integer(value)` - Convert to INTEGER
- `real(value)` - Convert to REAL
- `text(value)` - Convert to TEXT
- `boolean(value)` - Convert to BOOLEAN
- `blob(value)` - Convert to BLOB
- `date(value)` - Convert to DATE
- `time(value)` - Convert to TIME
- `datetime(value)` - Convert to DATETIME
- `timespan(value)` - Convert to TIMESPAN (supports ISO 8601 durations and human-readable strings)
- `json(value)` - Convert to JSON (parses JSON strings into native objects)

Note: CAST syntax is also supported for SQL compatibility, but conversion functions are preferred.

See [Built-in Functions Reference](functions.md#type-conversion-functions) for the full list of conversion functions, including `json()`, date/time arithmetic with modifiers, and validation functions.

## Type-Aware Comparisons

### Comparison Rules

1. **NULL Handling**: NULL compares less than any non-NULL value
2. **Type Matching**: Both values must have the same logical type
3. **Type-Specific Logic**: Each type defines its own comparison semantics
4. **Collation Support**: TEXT types use collation functions

```typescript
export function compareTypedValues(
  a: SqlValue,
  b: SqlValue,
  typeA: LogicalType,
  typeB: LogicalType,
  collation?: CollationFunction
): number {
  // NULL handling
  if (a === null) return b === null ? 0 : -1;
  if (b === null) return 1;

  // Type mismatch error
  if (typeA !== typeB) {
    throw new QuereusError(
      `Type mismatch in comparison: ${typeA.name} vs ${typeB.name}`,
      StatusCode.MISMATCH
    );
  }

  // Use type-specific comparison
  if (typeA.compare) {
    return typeA.compare(a, b, collation);
  }

  // Fallback to default comparison
  return defaultCompare(a, b, typeA.physicalType);
}
```

### Type Coercion in Comparisons

All expressions in Quereus have known types at plan time — including parameters, which must be typed at prepare time (either inferred from values or explicitly declared). There is no concept of an "untyped" expression.

When the planner encounters a comparison between operands of different type categories (e.g., numeric vs textual), it inserts an **explicit conversion** on the appropriate operand, matching the target type. For example, `integer_column = '25'` becomes equivalent to `integer_column = integer('25')` at plan time. This keeps the runtime free of implicit coercion — both sides of every comparison have matching type categories, enabling fast-path execution.

**Same-category comparisons** (both numeric, both textual, etc.) require no conversion and use a direct comparison path at runtime.

**Cross-category comparisons** are resolved at plan time by wrapping the mismatched operand in a conversion function node. The conversion targets the other operand's type category (e.g., textual → numeric via `integer()` or `real()`). Users can also write explicit conversions directly:

```sql
-- Explicit conversion (always preferred)
select * from users where age = integer('25');

-- Planner inserts equivalent conversion when types are mixed
select * from users where age = '25';
```

The planner also handles BETWEEN expressions the same way: `value BETWEEN '10' AND '100'` with a numeric `value` will have both bounds cast to the appropriate numeric type at plan time.

### Performance Characteristics

Type-aware comparisons enable optimized execution:

- **No runtime type detection**: Type is known at index/sort creation time
- **Direct comparator calls**: Comparator functions are resolved once and reused
- **Type-specific optimizations**: Each type can implement optimal comparison logic

---

## Collations and Types

### Type-Specific Collations

Collations are associated with specific types:

```typescript
const TEXT_TYPE: LogicalType = {
  name: 'TEXT',
  supportedCollations: ['BINARY', 'NOCASE', 'RTRIM'],
  compare: (a, b, collation) => collation(a as string, b as string),
};

const INTEGER_TYPE: LogicalType = {
  name: 'INTEGER',
  supportedCollations: undefined,  // No collations for numeric types
  compare: (a, b) => compareNumbers(a, b),
};
```

### Collation Validation

Schema creation validates collation compatibility:

```typescript
if (column.collation && column.logicalType.supportedCollations) {
  if (!column.logicalType.supportedCollations.includes(column.collation)) {
    throw new QuereusError(
      `Collation ${column.collation} not supported for type ${column.logicalType.name}`,
      StatusCode.ERROR
    );
  }
}
```

### Comparison collation resolution

A comparison (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, plus IN and each BETWEEN bound)
resolves ONE effective collation from its operands' types via a
**provenance-ranked lattice** (implemented once in
`planner/analysis/comparison-collation.ts`, shared by every plan-time
analysis and runtime emitter so the two cannot drift):

| rank | source (`ScalarType.collationSource`)                  | does BINARY contribute? |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 3    | `explicit` — a `COLLATE` expression                    | yes (`collate binary` is a real demand) |
| 2    | `declared` — column declared with an explicit `COLLATE`| yes (`c text collate binary` is a real preference) |
| 1    | `default` — defaulted column collation (session `default_collation`, store-module reconcile, engine BINARY default) | **no** — a defaulted BINARY contributes nothing |
| —    | no `collationName` (literals, most expressions)        | n/a |

Resolution of `left <op> right`:

1. The highest rank present among the two contributions wins.
2. If both operands contribute at that rank with **different** names:
   - rank 3 → plan-time error: `conflicting COLLATE clauses in comparison: X vs Y`
   - rank 2 → plan-time error: `ambiguous collation for comparison: column collations X vs Y differ; apply an explicit COLLATE`
   - rank 1 → **BINARY**, silently (defaults are preferences, not declarations)
3. Otherwise the winning contribution's name; no contributions at all → BINARY.

Resolution is **symmetric**: `a = b` and `b = a` always resolve identically
(and error identically). This deliberately diverges from SQLite's
left-operand precedence, in keeping with the engine's explicit-over-implicit
philosophy: a declared `NOCASE` column compared against a plain column is
NOCASE from either side, and genuinely ambiguous declared/explicit pairs are
errors rather than coin flips. Conflicts error even when the operands are
statically non-textual (consistent strictness; only `COLLATE`-wrapped
expressions can reach this case, since non-text columns reject collation
declarations).

Errors surface at the point the comparison compiles: statement prepare for
queries, DML prepare for write-path scopes (CHECK enforcement, FK
parent-existence checks, upsert SET, RETURNING).

**FOREIGN KEY collations are validated at declaration time.** A FK's enforced
comparison is `parent.k = child.fk`; the same lattice that resolves it at DML
prepare also runs at **declaration time** (CREATE TABLE / ALTER … ADD CONSTRAINT
/ ALTER … ADD COLUMN / declarative apply) over the two columns' `ScalarType`s, so
a same-rank conflicting pair is rejected the moment the `REFERENCES` clause is
declared rather than at the first write against the child
(`schema/constraint-builder.ts` `validateForeignKeyCollations`, mirroring the
FK-builder's comparison exactly — never a re-derived name- or textuality-based
rule). It is **unconditional** (not gated on `pragma foreign_keys`): a
contradictory declaration is malformed regardless of whether enforcement is
enabled. The one residual is a **forward-declared parent** (the parent table
does not exist yet when the child is declared): the parent column types are not
yet knowable, so the conflict stays caught at first DML — unchanged. Reload /
`importTable` deliberately does **not** re-validate, so a legacy persisted
conflicting FK reloads without error and still surfaces at DML.

**Provenance is a function of the current catalog column, not its history.**
A column reaches rank 2 (`declared`) two ways, with identical standing: a
CREATE-time explicit `COLLATE` clause, OR `ALTER COLUMN ... SET COLLATE`
(including `SET COLLATE binary` — a real BINARY demand, not the absence of
one). So the same `SET COLLATE NOCASE` resolves identically whether the column
was originally created with or without a `COLLATE` clause; the rank follows the
live column schema (`ColumnSchema.collationExplicit`), never how the column was
first declared.

**Rank-1 `default` provenance is session-transient.** It is not persisted as a
distinct bit: the catalog and persisted DDL are fully explicit (an explicit
`COLLATE` for every non-`BINARY` collation, `BINARY` elided — see docs/sql.md
§ 9.2.4). So a column that got `NOCASE` from session `default_collation`, or a
store-module reconcile default, carries rank 1 in-session but reloads through
the CREATE path as rank 2 (`declared`), because the re-parsed `COLLATE NOCASE`
sets `collationExplicit`. This reload upgrade is **fail-louder only**: a
comparison that previously resolved silently (to BINARY, or to the declared
side) can only become a prepare-time ambiguous-collation error — never silently
different results — so the upgrade needs no catalog/DDL representation change.
A defaulted *BINARY* (and an explicit `SET COLLATE binary`) reloads as rank 1
because `BINARY` is elided from DDL — consistent with a CREATE-time
`c text collate binary` column, which already round-trips to rank 1. This is the
one direction where reopen relaxes rather than tightens: an in-session rank-2
`collate binary` operand can make a comparison an ambiguous-collation error that,
after reopen, resolves silently (the elided BINARY contributes nothing at rank
1). The "fail-louder only" guarantee above covers the rank-1→rank-2 *upgrade* of
a non-BINARY default; the BINARY-elision *downgrade* of an explicit/declared
BINARY is the documented exception, and matches CREATE-time `collate binary`
either way.

Related forms:

- **IN** — `cond IN (e1, …, en)` / `cond IN (subquery)` merges the RHS
  contributions first (a rank-3/2 name conflict among elements is the same
  plan-time error; rank-1 conflicts merge to no contribution; a subquery
  contributes its output column's contribution), then resolves
  condition-vs-RHS through the lattice. The whole membership test runs under
  that ONE collation. Literal-only lists contribute nothing, so the dominant
  case stays condition-driven.
- **BETWEEN** — desugars to two independent comparisons (`expr >= lo`,
  `expr <= hi`); each bound resolves against the tested expression
  separately. Two differently-collated bounds are NOT a conflict with each
  other.
- **USING joins** — each same-named column pair resolves through the lattice,
  so `using (k)` agrees with the spelled-out `l.k = r.k`. The four pairwise
  join-key surfaces (USING comparator, merge / bloom / asof) all resolve their
  key collation through the same lattice — the sibling of set operations below.
- **Set operations** (`UNION` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT` / `DIFF`, and `UNION
  ALL`) — each OUTPUT column resolves its dedup/compare collation **symmetrically
  across BOTH inputs'** corresponding column types through the same lattice
  (`resolveSetOpColumnCollation`), rather than inheriting the left input's
  collation alone. The resolved collation is written into the
  `SetOperationNode`'s output column/attribute types, so it governs the dedup /
  membership comparator **and** the output column's `collationName` — i.e. what an
  enclosing `ORDER BY` over the set operation sorts under — in lockstep (one
  resolution site, both readers). The winning *rank* propagates as
  `collationSource`, so a nested set operation re-resolves against the inner
  node's output column **at the correct rank**, and divergence surfaces at every
  level. Conflict handling splits on whether the operator dedups:
    - **DISTINCT operators** (`UNION` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`; `DIFF` desugars to
      nested `EXCEPT`/`UNION`) DO compare, so a same-rank explicit/declared name
      conflict in any output column is the same prepare-time error a spelled-out
      comparison throws (surfaced when the compound's output scope is built).
    - **`UNION ALL`** does NO dedup, so a conflict is **not** an error — it
      propagates no collation forward (BINARY-equivalent), exactly as `||` / CASE
      swallow conflicts. Rows pass through unchanged.
  Non-textual columns carry no collation, so resolution is a harmless no-op.
  (No sort-merge set-op strategy exists today; if one is ever added it MUST
  derive its key collation from this same resolved output-column collation.)
- **Propagation through non-comparison combiners** (`||` concat, CASE branch
  merge) — the highest-ranked contribution wins and keeps its provenance;
  equal-rank contributions with different names propagate **no** collation
  (the conflict is not an error there — those nodes don't compare — but it
  must not silently coin-flip; a later comparison over the result falls back
  to BINARY).

### Custom Collations for Custom Types

Plugins can define type-specific collations:

```typescript
const PHONENUMBER_TYPE: LogicalType = {
  name: 'PHONENUMBER',
  physicalType: PhysicalType.TEXT,
  supportedCollations: ['AREA_CODE', 'COUNTRY_CODE'],
  compare: (a, b, collation) => {
    // Custom comparison logic based on collation
  },
};
```

---

## Plugin System

### Registering Custom Types

Plugins can register custom logical types. For the full plugin packaging and loading workflow, see the [Plugin System](plugins.md). The examples below show the type registration portion:

```typescript
// Example: UUID type plugin
export default function register(db: Database) {
  return {
    types: [
      {
        type: 'type',
        definition: {
          name: 'UUID',
          physicalType: PhysicalType.TEXT,

          validate: (v) =>
            typeof v === 'string' &&
            /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i.test(v),

          parse: (v) => {
            if (typeof v === 'string') return v.toLowerCase();
            throw new TypeError('Invalid UUID');
          },

          compare: (a, b) => (a as string).localeCompare(b as string),
        }
      }
    ]
  };
}
```

### Using Custom Types

```sql
-- After loading UUID plugin
create table users (
  id uuid primary key,
  name text not null
);

insert into users values ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'Alice');
```

## Polymorphic Function Type Inference

Quereus supports polymorphic functions that work over multiple type signatures without duplicating implementations.

### Type Inference API

Functions can define type inference logic at planning time:

```typescript
export interface ScalarFunctionSchema {
  name: string;
  numArgs: number;

  // Option A: Fixed return type
  returnType?: ScalarType;

  // Option B: Type inference function (for polymorphic functions)
  inferReturnType?: (argTypes: ReadonlyArray<DeepReadonly<LogicalType>>) => ScalarType;

  // Optional: Validate argument types at planning time
  validateArgTypes?: (argTypes: ReadonlyArray<DeepReadonly<LogicalType>>) => boolean;

  implementation: ScalarFunc;
}
```

### Examples

**Simple case: Fixed types**
```typescript
export const sqrtFunc = createScalarFunction({
  name: 'sqrt',
  numArgs: 1,
  returnType: { typeClass: 'scalar', logicalType: REAL_TYPE, nullable: false }
}, sqrtImpl);
```

**Polymorphic case: Type inference**
```typescript
export const absFunc = createScalarFunction({
  name: 'abs',
  numArgs: 1,
  inferReturnType: (argTypes) => ({
    typeClass: 'scalar',
    logicalType: argTypes[0], // Return same type as input
    nullable: false
  }),
  validateArgTypes: (argTypes) => argTypes[0].isNumeric
}, absImpl);
```

### Built-in Polymorphic Functions

The following built-in functions use type inference:

- **Numeric functions**: `abs()`, `round()`, `nullif()`, `sqrt()`, `floor()`, `ceil()`, `ceiling()`, `clamp()`
- **Common type resolution**: `coalesce()`, `iif()`, `greatest()`, `least()`, `choose()`
- **String functions**: `length()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `trim()`, `ltrim()`, `rtrim()`, `substr()`, `substring()`, `replace()`, `reverse()`, `lpad()`, `rpad()`, `instr()`
- **Aggregate functions**: `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- **Arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` with numeric type promotion (INTEGER + INTEGER → INTEGER, INTEGER + REAL → REAL, etc.)

### Type Promotion Rules

Arithmetic operators follow these type promotion rules:

- `INTEGER op INTEGER` → `INTEGER`
- `INTEGER op REAL` → `REAL`
- `REAL op INTEGER` → `REAL`
- `REAL op REAL` → `REAL`

## Parameter Types

### Overview

Parameters in Quereus have strong types that are established at prepare time and validated on each execution. This provides type safety while maintaining a user-friendly API for JavaScript developers.

### Two Ways to Specify Parameter Types

Quereus offers two approaches for specifying parameter types:

1. **Type Inference from Values** - Pass initial parameter values to `prepare()` and types are inferred
2. **Explicit Type Hints** - Pass a Map of explicit type hints to `prepare()`

### Type Inference Rules

When you pass parameter values, Quereus automatically infers the logical type based on the JavaScript type:

| JavaScript Type | Logical Type | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `null` | NULL | `null` |
| `number` (integer) | INTEGER | `42`, `0`, `-100` |
| `number` (float) | REAL | `3.14`, `2.5`, `-0.5` |
| `bigint` | INTEGER | `9007199254740991n` |
| `boolean` | BOOLEAN | `true`, `false` |
| `string` | TEXT | `'hello'`, `''` |
| `Uint8Array` | BLOB | `new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])` |
| `object` (plain) | JSON | `{ x: 1 }`, `[1, 2, 3]` |

**Note**: Strings are always inferred as TEXT type. Plain objects and arrays are inferred as JSON type. To use date/time types, either:
- Use conversion functions in your query: `date(:param)`, `time(:param)`, `datetime(:param)`
- Or pass the value through a conversion function before binding

### Type Resolution and Validation

Parameter types are established during the **planning phase** and validated on each execution:

1. **At prepare time**: Types are inferred from initial values or set via explicit parameter types
2. **At execution time**: Parameter values are validated against the established types
3. **No recompilation**: Prepared statements are NOT recompiled when parameter values change (only when types would change)
4. **Type safety**: Attempting to execute with incompatible types throws an error

### Examples

**Option 1: Type inference from initial values**

```javascript
// Prepare with initial INTEGER parameters
const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO users (id, age) VALUES (?, ?)', [1, 30]);

// Execute with the initial values
await stmt.run();

// Execute with different INTEGER values (no recompilation)
await stmt.run([2, 25]);
await stmt.run([3, 40]);

// This would throw an error - type mismatch (REAL vs INTEGER)
// await stmt.run([4, 25.5]); // Error: Parameter type mismatch

await stmt.finalize();
```

**Option 2: Explicit parameter types**

```javascript
import { INTEGER_TYPE, TEXT_TYPE } from '@quereus/quereus';

// Create explicit parameter types
const parameterTypes = new Map();
parameterTypes.set(1, { typeClass: 'scalar', logicalType: INTEGER_TYPE, nullable: false });
parameterTypes.set(2, { typeClass: 'scalar', logicalType: TEXT_TYPE, nullable: false });

// Prepare with explicit parameter types
const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)', parameterTypes);

// Execute with matching types
await stmt.run([1, 'Alice']);
await stmt.run([2, 'Bob']);

await stmt.finalize();
```

**Named parameters:**

```javascript
// Prepare with named parameters
const stmt = db.prepare(
  'INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (:id, :name, :age)',
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
);

await stmt.run(); // Uses initial values
await stmt.run({ id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 25 }); // Different values, same types

await stmt.finalize();
```

**Date/time conversion:**

```javascript
// String parameter converted to DATE in the query
await db.exec(
  'INSERT INTO events (id, event_date) VALUES (?, date(?))',
  [1, '2024-01-15']
);

// Or use conversion functions in WHERE clauses
const rows = [];
for await (const row of db.eval(
  'SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date = date(?)',
  ['2024-01-15']
)) {
  rows.push(row);
}
```

### Type Checking and Validation

Parameter type validation ensures type safety across executions:

- **Physical type validation**: Validates that JavaScript values are compatible with the **physical type** of the declared logical type
- **Type preservation**: Once established, parameter types are preserved across all executions of a prepared statement
- **Validation on execution**: Each execution validates that parameter values match the established physical types
- **NULL compatibility**: NULL values are compatible with any nullable parameter type
- **Flexible logical types**: Different logical types with the same physical type are compatible (e.g., `number` and `bigint` both work for INTEGER physical type)
- **No implicit conversion**: Physical type mismatches are rejected with clear error messages
- **Explicit conversion**: Use conversion functions like `integer()`, `real()`, `text()`, `date()`, etc. in your SQL to convert between types
- **Array/object scalar guard**: A parameter used directly (through `CAST`s) as a comparand in a scalar comparison (`= <> < <= > >=`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`) against a non-object scalar operand may not be bound to a JS array or plain object. The OBJECT storage class sorts above every scalar, so such a binding could never match — instead of silently returning no rows it throws `StatusCode.MISMATCH` at bind time (e.g. `where id = ?` with `[[1, 2]]`). JSON-vs-JSON comparisons (`jsoncol = :p`), function arguments (`json_array_length(?)`), projections (`select ? as v`), and storing into a JSON column are never flagged. Collected by `src/planner/analysis/scalar-param-usage.ts` from the logical plan.

**Examples of physical type compatibility:**
- INTEGER physical type accepts: `number` (integer), `bigint`
- REAL physical type accepts: `number` (any)
- TEXT physical type accepts: `string` (any string, including date-like strings)
- BOOLEAN physical type accepts: `boolean`
- BLOB physical type accepts: `Uint8Array`
- OBJECT physical type accepts: plain objects, arrays (for JSON)

### Performance Benefits

The parameter type system provides significant performance benefits:

1. **No recompilation**: Prepared statements are compiled once and reused, avoiding expensive recompilation
2. **Early validation**: Type errors are caught before execution begins
3. **Optimized plans**: The query planner can optimize based on known parameter types
4. **Future optimizations**: The system is designed to support automatic recompilation for significant optimizations (e.g., when NULL constants enable better plans)

### Implementation Details

**Key files:**
- `src/core/database.ts` - `prepare()` accepts parameter values or explicit types; `_buildPlan()` passes parameter types to planning
- `src/core/statement.ts` - Statement class manages parameter types and validation
- `src/core/param.ts` - `getParameterTypes()` infers types from parameter values
- `src/types/logical-type.ts` - `getPhysicalType()` determines physical type from JavaScript values; `physicalTypeName()` provides human-readable names
- `src/planner/scopes/param.ts` - `ParameterScope` receives parameter types directly and uses them during planning

**Design:**
- Parameter types (not dummy values) are passed directly to the planner
- The planner works with precise logical types from the start
- No intermediate conversion to/from dummy parameter values
- Clean separation between type inference (from JS values) and type usage (in planning)
- Validation checks physical type compatibility, not exact logical type matching

## Future Enhancements

### Comparison System Optimization

**Goal**: Pre-resolve comparators at index/sort creation time to eliminate runtime type detection.

**Current**: Comparisons use `compareSqlValues()` which performs runtime type detection on every call.

**Proposed**: Pre-create type-specific comparators at index creation time and store them in index metadata.

**Performance Target**: 2-3x speedup for index operations, joins, and sorts.

### JSON Enhancements

**Potential future work**:
- Indexing JSON properties (functional indexes on `json_extract`)
- JSON-specific index types for nested queries
