## 8. Transactions and Savepoints

Transactions group multiple operations into a single unit that either succeeds completely or fails completely.

### 8.1 BEGIN Transaction

Starts a new transaction.

**Syntax:**
```sql
begin [transaction]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Start a transaction
begin;

-- Start a transaction with explicit keyword
begin transaction;
```

> **On a `Database` shared by more than one caller, hand-rolled `begin` / … / `commit` across separate `db.exec()` calls is not indivisible.** Each call takes the engine's execution mutex separately, so another caller's statement can be granted it in between and run inside your transaction — and be rolled back with it. Use `db.exec(sql, params, { transaction: true })`, which runs the whole batch as one transaction under a single mutex hold; see [Atomic Batches](usage.md#atomic-batches). Under that option the SQL itself may not spell `begin` / `commit` / bare `rollback`.

### 8.2 COMMIT Transaction

Saves all changes made during the current transaction.

**Syntax:**
```sql
commit [transaction]
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Commit the current transaction
commit;
```

> A `commit` issued as its own `db.exec()` call ends whatever transaction is open when its turn at the mutex comes — which, on a shared `Database`, need not be the one the caller opened. See the note under [8.1](#81-begin-transaction) and [Atomic Batches](usage.md#atomic-batches).

### 8.3 ROLLBACK Transaction

Discards all changes made during the current transaction.

**Syntax:**
```sql
rollback [transaction]
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Discard all changes in the current transaction
rollback;
```

### 8.4 Savepoints

Savepoints allow partial transaction rollbacks.

**Create a savepoint:**
```sql
savepoint savepoint_name
```

**Rollback to a savepoint:**
```sql
rollback [transaction] to [savepoint] savepoint_name
```

**Release a savepoint:**
```sql
release [savepoint] savepoint_name
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Transaction with savepoints
begin;

insert into users (name, email) values ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');

savepoint after_alice;

insert into users (name, email) values ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');

-- Oops, we made a mistake with Bob
rollback to savepoint after_alice;

-- Only Alice is inserted, Bob's insert was rolled back
insert into users (name, email) values ('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com');

-- Release a savepoint (optional, mostly for cleanup)
release savepoint after_alice;

commit;
```

### 8.5 Transaction Best Practices

1. **Explicit Transactions**: Always use explicit transactions for multi-statement operations.
2. **Error Handling**: Combine transactions with proper error handling to ensure rollback on failure.
3. **Transaction Size**: Keep transactions as short as possible to reduce lock contention.
4. **Savepoints**: Use savepoints for partial rollback instead of entire transaction rollback.

**JavaScript Example with Quereus:**
```javascript
// Using explicit transactions in JavaScript
try {
  await db.exec("begin");
  
  const orderId = await db.get("insert into orders (customer_id, total) values (?, ?) returning (id)", [42, 129.99]);
  
  await db.exec("insert into order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) values (?, ?, ?)",
    [orderId, 101, 2]);
  await db.exec("insert into order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) values (?, ?, ?)",
    [orderId, 205, 1]);
  
  await db.exec("commit");
  console.log("Transaction committed successfully");
} catch (error) {
  await db.exec("rollback");
  console.error("Transaction failed:", error);
}
```

### 8.6 Concurrent Committed Reads

Ordinarily every statement — reads included — serializes behind the database's execution mutex, so a read waits for any in-flight write (including its commit) to finish. A caller can mark an individual read-only query as willing to see slightly older data via the API option `readConcurrency: 'committed'` (see [Usage § Concurrent Committed Reads](usage.md#concurrent-committed-reads-readconcurrency)); when eligible it runs immediately against each table's last **committed** state. How that interacts with transactions:

- **It never joins a transaction.** A concurrent read opens its own committed-snapshot connection per table and does not participate in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` or savepoints. A writer's implicit (autocommit) transaction that is open — even one blocked mid-commit — is unaffected by the read, and still commits or rolls back with its own outcome.
- **Inside an explicit `BEGIN` it always serializes.** A read within your own transaction must see the transaction's uncommitted writes, so the opt-in silently falls back to the normal serialized path there. The engine cannot tell *whose* transaction it is, so this also covers another caller's explicit transaction — including one opened by an [atomic `exec` batch](usage.md#atomic-batches), for that batch's whole duration.
- **Uncommitted and rolled-back writes are invisible.** The read serves a coherent snapshot as of some commit boundary at or before it began: staged rows from an in-flight write never appear, and a writer rolling back mid-read changes nothing the read observes.
- **A `BEGIN` issued after the read started does not affect it.** The read is already pinned to its committed snapshot and simply does not see the new transaction's writes.

The consequence to internalize: with the opt-in, an *unawaited* earlier write may not be visible to the read (the read no longer waits for it to land). That is the documented tradeoff, not a bug — use the default `'serialized'` mode (or `await` the write) when read-your-writes ordering matters.

## 9. PRAGMA Statements

PRAGMA statements are special commands that control the behavior of the Quereus database engine.

### 9.1 Basic Syntax

```sql
pragma name = value;
pragma name;  -- query the current value
```

The value may be a quoted string, a number, or a bareword (`pragma foreign_keys = on`). Boolean-typed pragmas accept `on`/`off`, `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, and `1`/`0`, in any case and in either bareword or quoted form.

### 9.2 Supported PRAGMA Statements

#### 9.2.1 default_vtab_module

Sets or queries the default virtual table module used when `create table` is called without a specific `using` clause.

```sql
-- Set default module to "memory"
pragma default_vtab_module = 'memory';

-- Query current default module
pragma default_vtab_module;
```

#### 9.2.2 default_vtab_args

Sets or queries the default arguments passed to the default virtual table module. The value should be a JSON array of strings.

```sql
-- Set default args for the default module
pragma default_vtab_args = '["create table x(id integer primary key, data text)"]';

-- Query current default args
pragma default_vtab_args;
```

#### 9.2.3 default_column_nullability

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Departure from SQL Standard**

Sets or queries the default nullability behavior for columns. This is a significant departure from the SQL standard, aligning with [The Third Manifesto](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DTATRM.pdf) principles which advocate against NULL by default.

**Values:**
- `'not_null'` (default): Columns are NOT NULL by default unless explicitly declared otherwise
- `'nullable'`: Standard SQL behavior - columns are nullable by default unless explicitly declared NOT NULL

```sql
-- Set to Third Manifesto behavior (default in Quereus)
pragma default_column_nullability = 'not_null';

-- Set to SQL standard behavior  
pragma default_column_nullability = 'nullable';

-- Query current setting
pragma default_column_nullability;
```

**Rationale:**
The Third Manifesto argues that NULL is fundamentally problematic in relational theory and that non-nullable types should be the default. Quereus follows this principle to avoid the "billion-dollar mistake" of NULL by default, while still allowing NULLs when explicitly needed.

**Examples:**

```sql
-- With default_column_nullability = 'not_null' (Quereus default)
create table users (
  id integer primary key, -- Implicitly NOT NULL
  name text,           -- Implicitly NOT NULL
  email text,          -- Implicitly NOT NULL  
  bio text null        -- Explicitly allows NULL
);

-- With default_column_nullability = 'nullable' (SQL standard)
create table users (
  id integer primary key, -- Allows NULL (primary key does not imply NOT NULL)
  name text,           -- Allows NULL
  email text not null, -- Explicitly NOT NULL
  bio text             -- Allows NULL
);
```

**Note:** This setting governs primary-key columns like any other — `primary key` names the
row identity and does not imply `not null`. Under the default `'not_null'` an undecorated
`id integer primary key` is still non-nullable (every column is); under `'nullable'`, or with
an explicit `x integer null primary key`, the key column accepts NULL and NULL participates in
the key as a self-equal value. See [Schema § Primary-key nullability](schema.md#columnschema).

#### 9.2.4 default_collation

Sets or queries the default **declared collation** for columns that carry no explicit
`COLLATE` clause. Defaults to `'BINARY'`, so out of the box there is no behavior change —
opt into `'NOCASE'` / `'RTRIM'` / any registered collation per database.

**Values:**
- `'BINARY'` (default): omitted-`COLLATE` columns are byte-compared (case-sensitive).
- `'NOCASE'` / `'RTRIM'` / any registered collation name: omitted-`COLLATE` columns resolve
  to that collation, **but only for types that support it** (text). Non-text columns
  (`INTEGER`/`REAL`/`BLOB`) and empty-collation types (`JSON`, temporal) fall back to
  `BINARY`. An invalid collation name is rejected at set time (the pragma value rolls back).

```sql
-- Make omitted-COLLATE text columns case-insensitive for this database
pragma default_collation = 'nocase';

create table users (
  id integer primary key,     -- INTEGER → BINARY (NOCASE unsupported)
  name text,                  -- TEXT, no COLLATE → resolves to NOCASE
  code text collate binary    -- explicit COLLATE always wins → BINARY
);

-- Query current setting
pragma default_collation;

-- Restore byte-comparison default
pragma default_collation = 'binary';
```

**Semantics (important):** `default_collation` is a **schema-authoring convenience
only**. The catalog always stores the concrete, resolved collation, and persisted DDL always
emits an explicit `COLLATE` for any non-`BINARY` collation. So a table created under
`default_collation = 'nocase'` round-trips its `NOCASE` columns unambiguously even when the
database is later reopened (or its DDL re-executed) under a different — or the default —
`default_collation`. An explicit `COLLATE` clause always overrides the session default.

`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` honors the default the same way `CREATE TABLE` does: an added
text column with no explicit `COLLATE` resolves to the session default (non-text falls back to
`BINARY`), so an added column gets the same collation a `CREATE`-d one would. `RENAME COLUMN`
deliberately does **not** consult the default — it preserves the renamed column's existing
collation rather than re-resolving it to the current session setting.

Because "the catalog always stores the concrete, resolved collation" is enforced by emitting an
explicit `COLLATE` for every non-`BINARY` collation, a column whose collation came from the
session default is *defaulted* in-session (rank 1, `default`) but reloads as *declared* (rank 2)
after a reopen or DDL re-execution — the re-parsed `COLLATE` clause is indistinguishable from a
hand-written one. This is intended: the comparison-collation rank may rise from rank 1 to rank 2
across the persistence boundary, and the only observable effect is *stricter* (fail-louder)
conflict detection — a comparison that previously resolved silently can become a prepare-time
ambiguous-collation error, never silently different results (see docs/types.md § Comparison
collation resolution). `ALTER COLUMN ... SET COLLATE` likewise marks the collation explicit
(rank 2) in-session, with the same standing as a CREATE-time `COLLATE`.

#### 9.2.5 nondeterministic_schema

Allows non-deterministic expressions (`random()`, `datetime('now')`, user-defined functions
marked non-deterministic, etc.) inside DEFAULT, CHECK, and `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` clauses.
Defaults to `false` (strict rejection) for backward compatibility.

**Aliases:** `allow_nondeterministic_schema_expressions`

**Values:**
- `false` (default) — strict rejection: a CREATE TABLE / INSERT / UPDATE that compiles a
  non-deterministic expression in a DEFAULT, CHECK, or generated-column clause raises
  `Non-deterministic expression not allowed in …`.
- `true` — permit non-deterministic expressions. Per-row evaluation still produces a
  concrete literal at the `vtab.update()` frontier (captured in `args.values` and in the
  literal SQL produced by `buildInsertStatement` / `buildUpdateStatement` /
  `buildDeleteStatement`), so the replay contract — "apply primitives at the module-layer
  boundary" — is preserved.

```sql
-- Default: strict rejection
create table t (id integer primary key, ts text default datetime('now'));
-- error: Non-deterministic expression not allowed in DEFAULT

-- Relax the gate
pragma nondeterministic_schema = true;

create table audit (
  id integer primary key,
  ts text default datetime('now'),         -- now permitted
  tag integer generated always as (random()) stored
);

insert into audit (id) values (1);
-- The row stored carries a concrete ts string and concrete tag integer.
```

**Scope:** The option is read at validation time. Toggling it affects validation of
*subsequent* DDL / DML only; tables already created retain whatever expressions they
were created with. The option is not baked into any persisted schema.

**See also:** [Determinism Validation](determinism.md) for the full
replay-contract discussion, and [Mutation Statements](module-authoring.md#mutation-statements)
for how the captured artifact is structured.

#### 9.2.6 schema_path

Sets or queries the default schema search path used when resolving unqualified relation names — tables, views and materialized views alike. The value is a comma-separated list of schema names.

**Values:**
- Comma-separated list of schema names (e.g., `'main,extensions,plugins'`)
- Empty string or `'main'` to use only the default schema

```sql
-- Set search path for the connection
pragma schema_path = 'main,extensions,plugins';

-- Query current search path
pragma schema_path;
-- Returns: "main,extensions,plugins"

-- Reset to default
pragma schema_path = 'main';
```

**Resolution Order:**

When resolving unqualified table names:
1. Qualified names (`schema.table`) are used exactly as specified
2. `WITH SCHEMA` clause on the statement (highest priority)
3. `PRAGMA schema_path` setting (session default)
4. Default schema (`main`)

A **stored body** (a view or materialized-view definition) is the exception: it resolves its unqualified names against the owning object's own schema first, then the session default path — never the reading statement's `WITH SCHEMA` path. See [SQL Reference § Schema Search Path](sql-select.md#211-schema-search-path-with-schema).

**Examples:**

```sql
-- Set search path for the session
pragma schema_path = 'workspace,main';

-- All subsequent queries use this path
select * from users;  -- Searches workspace.users, then main.users

-- Override per-query with WITH SCHEMA
select * from users with schema main;  -- Only searches main.users
```

### 9.3 Examples

```sql
-- Configure default VTab settings
pragma default_vtab_module = 'memory';
pragma default_vtab_args = '[]';

-- Set Third Manifesto-aligned nullability (default)
pragma default_column_nullability = 'not_null';

-- Set schema search path
pragma schema_path = 'main,extensions';

-- Create a table using the default module and nullability
create table simple_cache (
  key text primary key,
  value text              -- NOT NULL by default with 'not_null' setting
);
-- Equivalent to: create table simple_cache (...) using memory;

-- Tables will be resolved from main first, then extensions
select * from users;  -- Searches main.users, then extensions.users
```

### 9.4 Transactions Control PRAGMAs

These PRAGMAs are parsed but may not affect behavior in the same way as SQLite due to Quereus's virtual table-centric architecture.

```sql
pragma journal_mode = 'memory';
pragma synchronous = 'off';
```

### 9.5 ANALYZE

The `ANALYZE` command collects table statistics for cost-based query optimization. Statistics include row counts, per-column distinct value counts, null counts, min/max values, and equi-height histograms for selectivity estimation.

```sql
-- Analyze all tables in the default schema
analyze;

-- Analyze a specific table
analyze products;

-- Analyze a table in a specific schema
analyze main.products;

-- Analyze every table in a specific schema
analyze main.*;

-- The temp schema qualifier works too
analyze temp.scratch;
```

`ANALYZE` returns one row per table with columns `table` (text) and `rows` (integer).

A named target (`analyze <table>` or `analyze <schema>.<table>`) is resolved the same way any other statement resolves a table name — an unqualified name follows the session search path (`pragma schema_path`) — and it must exist and must be a real table, or the statement raises an error rather than silently returning nothing. A plain view is rejected by name: it stores no rows to collect statistics from. A materialized view is a real backing table and is analyzed like any other. `ANALYZE <schema>.*` likewise errors if `<schema>` does not exist. Bare `ANALYZE` and `ANALYZE <schema>.*` on a schema with no tables still return zero rows — that is not an error, there is simply nothing to analyze. Bare `ANALYZE` covers the `main` schema only, regardless of the search path (backlog `bug-bare-analyze-only-covers-main`).

A virtual table module that implements `getStatistics()` may answer the whole question, part of it, or none of it, and `ANALYZE` scans for whatever it did not answer:

- **A full answer** (a row count *and* a non-empty `columnStats`) is used directly, with no scan.
- **A partial answer** — a row count with an *empty* `columnStats` — reads as "size answered, collect the rest yourself". Both shipped backends answer this way: they can size themselves in O(1) but keep no value distribution. `ANALYZE` scans for the per-column numbers and prefers the scan's row count, since it counted every live row while a maintained count can drift.
- **A decline** (`undefined`) is treated exactly like an unimplemented hook, and is what a wrapper returns when its cheap answer would be wrong for the read it is serving — the isolation layer declines while a transaction's overlay is dirty.
- **No hook at all** scans as well.

The scan collects exact per-column distinct counts, null counts and min/max over every row the connection can see, plus histograms built from a sample of the values. Collected statistics are cached on the table schema and used by the optimizer's `CatalogStatsProvider` for improved cost estimates. See `docs/module-authoring.md` for the module-side contract.

#### Automatic statistics refresh

Statistics also refresh on their own. Every committed transaction reports how many
distinct rows it changed per table, and a table whose drift crosses a threshold has
its statistics recollected in the background — by running exactly the `ANALYZE` above
for that one table.

```
stale  ⟺  rows changed since the last refresh  >=  max(auto_analyze_min_mutations,
                                                       auto_analyze_ratio × known rows)
```

| option | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto_analyze` | `true` | Master switch. Off means no counting and no refreshing |
| `auto_analyze_min_mutations` | `500` | Absolute floor of the threshold, in changed rows |
| `auto_analyze_ratio` | `0.2` | Fraction of the known row count that must change |
| `auto_analyze_row_limit` | `100000` | Largest table (in known rows) a refresh will scan; `0` removes the cap |

What that means in practice:

- **It never runs on the write path.** A crossing arms a short debounce timer; the
  refresh runs from that timer and acquires the same execution mutex every statement
  uses, so it queues behind your work rather than racing it. No write and no query
  ever waits on it.
- **Crossings coalesce.** Commits that arrive while a refresh is armed or running are
  absorbed into it, so a bulk load costs a handful of refreshes rather than one per
  commit. A table is additionally limited to a small fraction of wall-clock time in
  automatic `ANALYZE`, so a sustained write load cannot turn into a rescan treadmill.
- **Large tables are skipped.** A table whose known row count exceeds
  `auto_analyze_row_limit` is left to an explicit `ANALYZE`; the skip is logged once.
  A table nobody has ever analyzed reports zero known rows, so its first refresh is
  not size-gated — after that the cap applies.
- **It is delayed while a transaction is open**, because collecting statistics inside
  your transaction would fold your uncommitted rows into them. That covers more than an
  explicit `BEGIN`: every writing statement (`insert`, `update`, `delete`, and any DDL)
  runs inside an implicit transaction for its duration, so a refresh whose timer fires
  mid-statement is delayed too. Read-only statements open no transaction and delay
  nothing.

  A delayed refresh reschedules itself a few times on a widening backoff (a quarter of
  a second, then doubling, about four seconds of patience in total), so an ordinary
  statement in flight only postpones the refresh rather than cancelling it. Once that
  patience runs out — a transaction you have parked open, say — the refresh is dropped
  and the next commit that touches the table is what schedules a new one. Either way the
  drift counter is left untouched, so the staleness stays visible and nothing is
  double-counted.
- **Staleness counting restarts when the process does.** Statistics a store backend
  persisted are still there after a reopen, but the drift accumulated before the
  restart is not — a table that drifted while the process was down looks fresh until
  it drifts again.
- **A hand-typed `ANALYZE` does not reset the drift counter.** Only an automatic
  refresh does. Analyzing an already-stale table by hand can therefore cost one
  redundant background rescan, after which the counter is back in step.
- **Every refresh invalidates cached plans for that table**, exactly as a manual
  `ANALYZE` does — that is the point, since the new statistics should change plans.

For guidance on when to run `ANALYZE` yourself, see `docs/usage.md`.
